# Definitions of ML[^def-ML]

**Machine learning** is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through learning from data, without being explicitly programmed. There are several popular definitions of machine learning.

```{admonition} Arthur Samuel's Definition (1959)
:class: note
The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
```

```{admonition} Tom Mitchell's Definition (1997)
A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$ if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.
```

This definition provides a more formal framework for understanding machine learning, emphasizing the improvement in task performance through learning.

```{admonition} Arthur Samuel's Practical Definition:
Arthur Samuel also offered a practical definition of machine learning as "the ability to improve the performance of a task by being exposed to data.
```

This definition underscores the practical aspect of machine learning, where algorithms improve their performance by processing and learning from data.

```{admonition} Modern Definition
A field of AI that uses statistical techniques and algorithms to enable computer systems to recognize patterns in data, make predictions, classify information, and automate decision-making based on the learned patterns and insights.
```

These definitions collectively capture the core idea of machine learning, which is the ability of computers to learn from data and adapt their behavior or performance on specific tasks.
