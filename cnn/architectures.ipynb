    "The basic architecture of a convolutional neural network consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers. A fully connected layer is always used at the network output. In addition to these three layers, there are two more important parameters which are the dropout layer and the activation function which are defined below.\n",

    "The convolution layer is the first layer that is used to extract various objects from the input images and transfer the result to the unifying layer. It also ensures that spatial relationships between pixels are preserved.\n",

    "## Pooling layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling model generalises the features extracted by the convolution layer, and helps the networks to recognize the features independently. With the help of this, the computations are also reduced in a network.\n",

    "The first convolutional neural network that showed SATA (State Of The Art) results on the MNIST digit image classification task. For the first time, convolutional layers with a 5x5 core were successfully used in the architecture. Tanh was used as activation, and average was used instead of max pool at that moment.\n",

This network showed, for the first time, that the features obtained by learning can transcend manually-designed features, breaking the previous paradigm in computer vision.\n",

    "\n",
    "A very popular model for fast inference (on mobile devices or gpu). Although it loses a little to the \"monsters\" in terms of quality, it turns out that this is often enough in the industry (especially if you take the latest versions of the model). The main detail is the use of depthwise convolutions: parallel stacking of 3x3x1x1 convolutions – that is, those in which the calculation for each output channel occurs only based on the characteristics of the input channel. To combine features between channels, a classic 1x1 convolution is used.\n",
