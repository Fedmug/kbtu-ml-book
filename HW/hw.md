## General recommendations

* Do not erase any existing cells

* Write solutions of the math problems in markdown cells of HW notebook using LaTeX. If you are not familiar with LaTeX, see a 2-page [cheat sheet](http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf) for a quick start

* Provide your solution with understandable comments; do not submit tons of formulas and/or code  cells without any text description of what you are doing

* **Readability counts!** In case of poor writings you may receive penalty up to one point
