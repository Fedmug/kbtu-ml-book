    "problem": "What is the degree measure of an angle whose measure is double the measure of its complement?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Two angles are complementary if their degree measures add up to 90 degrees. So if the angle is $x$ degrees, then its complement is $90-x$ degrees. We set up the equation $x=2(90-x)$ and solve for $x$. $$x=180-2x\\qquad\\Rightarrow3x=180\\qquad\\Rightarrow x=60$$So the angle has a degree measure of $\\boxed{60}$ degrees."
