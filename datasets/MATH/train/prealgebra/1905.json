    "problem": "Find $0.4 \\cdot 0.6$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that $0.4$ is equivalent to $4 \\cdot 10^{-1}$, and similarly $0.6$ is equivalent to $6 \\cdot 10^{-1}$.  Multiplying these two numbers, we have $(4 \\cdot 10^{-1}) \\cdot (6 \\cdot 10^{-1})$, which can be rearranged as $(4 \\cdot 6) \\cdot (10^{-1} \\cdot 10^{-1})$. This simplifies to $24 \\cdot (10^{-2})$, which is $\\boxed{0.24}$."
