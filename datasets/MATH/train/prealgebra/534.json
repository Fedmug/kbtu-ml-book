    "problem": "The greatest common divisor of 21 and some number between 50 and 60 is 7. What is the number?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the greatest common divisor with 21 is 7, then the other number must be a multiple of 7. The only multiple of 7 between 50 and 60 is $\\boxed{56}$, so that is our answer."
