    "problem": "How many three-digit positive integers exist, all of whose digits are 2's and/or 5's?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since any of the digits may be a 2 or a 5, this leaves us 2 choices for each digit. There are then $2^3 =\\boxed{8}$ 3-digit integers composed of only 2s and/or 5s."
