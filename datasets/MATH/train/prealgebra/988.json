    "problem": "The circumference of a particular circle is 18 cm. In square centimeters, what is the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then the circumference is $2\\pi r$.  Setting $2\\pi r$ equal to 18 cm, we find $r=9/\\pi$ cm.  The area of the circle is $\\pi r^2=\\pi\\left(\\dfrac{9}{\\pi}\\right)^2=\\boxed{\\dfrac{81}{\\pi}}$ square centimeters."
