    "problem": "A designer has 3 fabric colors he may use for a dress: red, green, and blue. Four different patterns are available for the dress. If each dress design requires exactly one color and one pattern, how many different dress designs are possible?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "For each fabric color, the designer can choose one of four patterns. Thus, as there are three potential fabric colors, the designer can create $3 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{12}$ different dress designs."
