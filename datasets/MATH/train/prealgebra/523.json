    "problem": "When a number is divided by 3, the result is 50 more than if the number had been divided by 4.  What is the number?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We are asked to solve \\[\n\\frac{x}{3}=50+\\frac{x}{4}.\n\\] Subtract $x/4$ from both sides to find $x/12=50$, which implies $x=\\boxed{600}$."
