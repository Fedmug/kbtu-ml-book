    "problem": "It takes Alice $25$ minutes to clean her room. It takes Bob $\\frac{2}{5}$ of that amount of time to clean his room. How many minutes does it take Bob to clean his room?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Remembering that ``of\" means multiply, we want to find $\\frac{2}{5} \\times 25$. Since multiplication is commutative, we have: \\[\\frac{2}{5} \\times 25 = \\frac{25}{5} \\times 2\\]A fraction is another way to represent division, so $\\frac{25}{5} = 25\\div5 = 5$, and $5\\times2 = \\boxed{10}$ minutes."
