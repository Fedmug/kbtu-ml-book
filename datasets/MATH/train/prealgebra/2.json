    "problem": "Find the product of $0.\\overline{6}$ and 6.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First let's convert $0.\\overline{6}$ to a fraction. Let $p=0.\\overline{6}$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to obtain $10p=6.\\overline{6}$. Subtracting the left-hand sides $10p$ and $p$ as well as the right-hand sides $6.\\overline{6}$ and $0.\\overline{6}$ of these two equations gives $9p=6$, which implies $p=6/9$. We reduce $\\frac{6}{9}$ to $\\frac{2}{3}$ and multiply by 6 to obtain  \\[\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times 6 = \\frac{2\\cdot 6}{3}=\\boxed{4}.\n\\]"
