    "problem": "Andrea notices that the 40-foot tree next to her is casting a 10-foot shadow. How tall, in inches, is Andrea if she is casting a 15-inch shadow at the same time?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The ratio of the height of an object to the length of its shadow is $(40\\text{ feet})/(10\\text{ feet})=4$, so Andrea is $4\\times 15\\text{ inches}=\\boxed{60}$ inches tall."
