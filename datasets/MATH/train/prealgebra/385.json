    "problem": "The measures of the interior angles of a particular triangle are in a 5:6:7 ratio. What is the measure, in degrees, of the smallest interior angle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Choose $k$ so that the smallest angle measures $5k$ degrees.  Then the measures of the other two angles are $6k$ degrees and $7k$ degrees.  Since the measures of the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have $5k+6k+7k=180\\implies 18k=180\\implies k=10$.  The smallest angle measures $5k=5(10)=\\boxed{50}$ degrees."
