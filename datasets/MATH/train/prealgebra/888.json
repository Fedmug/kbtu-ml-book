    "problem": "Compute $-8\\cdot 4-(-6\\cdot -3)+(-10\\cdot -5)$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The order of operations says that we must perform the multiplication before the addition and subtraction.  Recall that ``negative times positive equals negative\" and ``negative times negative equals positive\".  We obtain \\begin{align*}\n-8\\cdot 4-(-6\\cdot -3)+(-10\\cdot -5)&=-32-18+50\\\\\n&=-(32+18)+50\\\\\n&=-50+50 \\\\\n&=50+(-50) \\\\\n&=50-50 \\\\\n&=\\boxed{0}.\n\\end{align*}"
