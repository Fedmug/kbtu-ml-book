    "problem": "It costs 5 cents to copy 3 pages. How many pages can you copy for $\\$20$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We are given the conversion factor $\\frac{3\\text{ pages}}{5\\text{ cents}} = 1$. We want to find how many pages we can copy for $\\$20$, which is equal to $2000$ cents. Thus, we can copy \\[2000\\text{ cents}\\cdot \\frac{3\\text{ pages}}{5\\text{ cents}} = \\boxed{1200}\\text{ pages}.\\]"
