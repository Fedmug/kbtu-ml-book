    "problem": "An athlete's heart beats an average of 150 times per minute while running. How many times does the athlete's heart beat during a 26-mile race if the athlete runs at a pace of 5 minutes per mile?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the athlete runs at a pace of $5$ minutes/mile, the entire race will take $5\\text{ mins/mile}\\times26\\text{ miles}=130$ minutes.  The athlete's heart is beating 150 times per minutes, so the total number of heart beats will be $130 \\text{ minutes}\\times150\\text{ beats/minute}=\\boxed{19500}$."
