    "problem": "Express as a common fraction: $0.\\overline5+0.\\overline1-0.\\overline3$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In general, to express the number $0.\\overline{n}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&10x &=& n&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.nnnnn\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&9x &=& n &\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.\\overline{n} = \\frac{n}{9}$.\n\nHence, our original problem reduces to computing $\\frac 59 + \\frac 19 - \\frac 39 = \\frac 39 = \\boxed{\\frac 13}$."
