    "problem": "The average age of 33 fifth-graders is 11. The average age of 55 of their parents is 33. What is the average age of all of these parents and fifth-graders?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the ages of the fifth graders is $33 \\cdot 11,$ while the sum of the ages of the parents is $55 \\cdot 33.$ Therefore, the sum of all their ages is \\[33 \\cdot 11 + 55 \\cdot 33 = 33 (11 + 55) = 33 \\cdot 66.\\]Since there are $33 + 55 = 88$ people in total, their average age is \\[\\frac{33 \\cdot 66}{88} = \\frac{33 \\cdot 3}{4} = \\frac{99}{4} = \\boxed{24.75}.\\]"
