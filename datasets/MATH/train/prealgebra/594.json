    "problem": "What is the sum of the prime factors of 91?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since 91 is not divisible by the first three prime numbers, we try dividing $91\\div 7$.  We find a quotient of 13, so $91=7\\times 13$ and the sum of these prime factors is $7+13=\\boxed{20}$."
