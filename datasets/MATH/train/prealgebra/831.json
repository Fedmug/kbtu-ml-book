    "problem": "The $\\$4.55$ in Carol's piggy bank consists of quarters and nickels. There are seven more nickels than quarters. How many nickels does Carol have in her bank?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $n$ and $q$ represent the respective numbers of nickels and quarters. Since there are seven more nickels than quarters, we know that $q=n-7$. In cents, the amount of money Carol has is $5n+25q=455$. We substitute the expression of $q$ in terms of $n$ from the first equation into the second equation. \\begin{align*}\n5n+25(n-7)&=455\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn+5(n-7)&=91\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn+5n-35&=91\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n6n&=126\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nn&=21\n\\end{align*} Carol has $\\boxed{21}$ nickels in her piggy bank."
