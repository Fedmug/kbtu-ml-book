    "problem": "The bottoms of two vertical poles are 12 feet apart and are on a region of flat ground. One pole is 6 feet tall and the other is 15 feet tall. How long, in feet, is a wire stretched from the top of one pole to the top of the other pole?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Picturing the situation, we have a trapezoid with the two poles as bases. We can split this trapezoid into a rectangle at the bottom and a right triangle at the top, where the hypotenuse of the right triangle is the wire stretched from the top of one pole to the top of the other pole.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.15inch);\npair A,B,C,D,F;\nA = (0,0);\nB= (12,0);\nC = (12,15);\nD = (0,6);\nF = (12,6);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A);\ndraw(D--F,dashed);\nlabel(\"$12$\",B/2,S);\nlabel(\"$12$\",(D+F)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$6$\",D/2,W);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(F+B)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(F+C)/2,E);\n[/asy]\n\n\nThe horizontal leg of the right triangle is 12 feet, the horizontal distance from one pole to the other. The vertical leg of the triangle is $15-6=9$ feet, the height difference of the poles. By the Pythagorean Theorem $a^2+b^2=c^2$, we can solve for the length of the hypotenuse. We get $c=\\sqrt{144+81}=\\sqrt{225}=15$. So the wire is $\\boxed{15}$ feet long.\n\nAlternatively, instead of using the Pythagorean Theorem, we notice that 9-12-$c$ has the same ratios as the 3-4-5 right triangle. So $c=3\\cdot5=\\boxed{15}$."
