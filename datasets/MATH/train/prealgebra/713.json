    "problem": "At a party, each man danced with exactly three women and each woman danced with exactly two men. Twelve men attended the party. How many women attended the party?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because each man danced with exactly three women, there were $(12)(3)=36$ pairs of men and women who danced together. Each woman had two partners, so the number of women who attended is $36/2=\\boxed{18}.$"
