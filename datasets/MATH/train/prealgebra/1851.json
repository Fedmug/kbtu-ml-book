    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recalling that \"of\" means \"times,\" we have \\[\\frac56\\cdot 30 = \\frac{5\\cdot 30}{6} = 5\\cdot \\frac{30}{6} = 5\\cdot 5 = \\boxed{25}.\\]We almost might simply have computed \\[\\frac56\\cdot 30 = \\frac{5\\cdot 30}{6} = \\frac{150}{6} = 150\\div 6 = \\boxed{25}.\\]"
