    "problem": "Billy Goats invested some money in stocks and bonds. The total amount he invested was $\\$165,\\!000$. If he invested 4.5 times as much in stocks as he did in bonds, what was his total investment in stocks?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the amount of money Billy invested in bonds be $s.$ Then, the amount of money he invested in stocks is $4.5s.$ The total amount of money he invested is $s+4.5s=5.5s=165,\\!000.$ Thus, $s=\\frac{165,\\!000}{5.5}=30,\\!000.$ Finally, the amount invested in stocks is $4.5s=4.5\\cdot30,\\!000=\\boxed{135,\\!000}$ dollars."
