    "problem": "The U.S. produces about 5.5 million tons of apples each year. Of the total, $20\\%$ is mixed with other products, with $50\\%$ of the remainder used for apple juice and the other $50\\%$ sold fresh. How many million tons of apples are used for apple juice? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, we wish to determine what percentage of the tons of apples are used for apple juice. After $20\\%$ is mixed with other products, $80\\%$ remains. Half of this is used for apple juice; therefore, $40\\%$ of the tons of apples is used for apple juice. To calculate $40\\%$ of $5.5$ million tons, we find $10\\%$ and then multiply by four. $10\\% = 0.55$, and $0.55 \\cdot 4 = 2.2$. Thus, $\\boxed{2.2}$ million tons are used for apple juice."
