    "problem": "Jamie has a jar of coins containing the same number of nickels, dimes and quarters. The total value of the coins in the jar is $\\$$13.20. How many nickels does Jamie have?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Writing the problem in cents, and letting the number of each coin be $x$, we have $5x + 10x + 25x = 1320$, or $40x = 1320$. This gives immediately $x =\n\\boxed{33}$."
