    "problem": "What is the least three-digit positive integer that has 2, 5 and 7 as factors?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since 2, 5, 7 are pairwise relatively prime (meaning that no two of them share a prime factor), we must find the least three-digit positive integer that is divisible by $2\\cdot5\\cdot7=70$. That integer is $70\\cdot2=\\boxed{140}$."
