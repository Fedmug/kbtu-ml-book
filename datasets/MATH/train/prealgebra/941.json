    "problem": "Tracy had a bag of candies, and none of the candies could be broken into pieces. She ate $\\frac{1}{3}$ of them and then gave $\\frac{1}{4}$ of what remained to her friend Rachel. Tracy and her mom then each ate 15 candies from what Tracy had left. Finally, Tracy's brother took somewhere from one to five candies, leaving Tracy with three candies. How many candies did Tracy have at the start?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be Tracy's starting number of candies. After eating $\\frac{1}{3}$ of them, she had $\\frac{2}{3}x$ left. Since $\\frac{2}{3}x$ is an integer, $x$ is divisible by 3. After giving $\\frac{1}{4}$ of this to Rachel, she had $\\frac{3}{4}$ of $\\frac{2}{3}x$ left, for a total of $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}x = \\frac{1}{2}x$. Since $\\frac{1}{2}x$ is an integer, $x$ is divisible by 2. Since $x$ is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6.\n\nAfter Tracy and her mom each ate 15 candies (they ate a total of 30), Tracy had $\\frac{1}{2}x - 30$ candies left. After her brother took 1 to 5 candies, Tracy was left with 3. This means Tracy had 4 to 8 candies before her brother took some candies. Hence,  $$\n4 \\le \\frac{1}{2}x - 30 \\le 8\\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad 34 \\le \\frac{1}{2}x \\le 38\\qquad  \\Rightarrow \\qquad 68 \\le x \\le 76.\n$$Since $x$ is divisible by 6, and the only multiple of 6 in the above range is 72, we have $x = \\boxed{72}$."
