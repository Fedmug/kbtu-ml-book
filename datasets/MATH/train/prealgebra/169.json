    "problem": "Round $54.\\overline{54}$ to the nearest hundredth.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To round $54.\\overline{54}$ to the nearest hundredth, we must look at the hundreds and the thousands digits of the number in question. We write it as \\[54.\\overline{54} = 54.5454\\overline{54}.\\]Since the thousands digit ($5$) is greater than or equal to $5$, the hundreds digit $4$ rounds up to $5$. Therefore, $54.\\overline{54}$ rounded to the nearest hundredth is equal to $\\boxed{54.55}$."
