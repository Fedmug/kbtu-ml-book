    "problem": "Don has a bottle of milk with $\\frac{1}{5}$ of a gallon of milk in it. Don's friend Rachel drinks $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the milk he has. How many gallons of milk did Rachel drink?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Rachel drinks $\\frac{2}{3}$ of Don's $\\frac{1}{5}$ of a gallon of milk. The word \"of\" means multiply, so Rachel drinks $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5}$ gallons of milk. Multiplying, we get $\\frac{(2)(1)}{(3)(5)}=\\boxed{\\frac{2}{15}}$ gallons."
