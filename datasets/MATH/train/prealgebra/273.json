    "problem": "For how many two-digit prime numbers is the sum of its digits 8?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The possibilities for the two digits are 0 and 8, 1 and 7, 2 and 6, 3 and 5, and 4 and 4. Of these, a prime number could only be made from the 1 and 7 or the 3 and 5. 17, 71, and 53 are prime, but 35 is not. Thus, there are $\\boxed{3}$ such two-digit prime numbers."
