    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of 84, 112 and 210?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of 84 is $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7$, the prime factorization of 112 is $2^4 \\times 7$, and the prime factorization of 210 is $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7$. The greatest common factor of the three numbers is the product of all the prime factors that they have in common, which is $2 \\times 7 = \\boxed{14}.$"
