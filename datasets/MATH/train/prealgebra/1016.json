    "problem": "100 people who were surveyed and asked the question: ``Is fuchsia kinda pink, or purply?'' Of them, 60 believe that fuchsia is ``kinda pink'' and 27 believe it is both ``kinda pink,'' and also ``purply.''  Another 17 think that fuchsia is neither ``kinda pink'' nor ``purply.''\n\nHow many of those 100 people believe that fuchsia is ``purply''?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We can answer this question with a Venn diagram.  First we know that the intersection of ``kinda pink'' and ``purply'' contains 27 people.  We also know that 17 people fall outside both circles. [asy]\nlabel(\"kinda pink\", (2,75));\nlabel(\"purply\", (80,75));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$27$\", (44, 45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$4$\",(28,45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$43$\",(63,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$17$\", (70, 15));\n[/asy] Since the ``kinda pink'' circle must contain 60 people total, $60-27=33$ people must believe fuchsia is ``kinda pink,'' but not ``purply.'' [asy]\nlabel(\"kinda pink\", (2,75));\nlabel(\"purply\", (80,75));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$27$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$33$\",(28,45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$43$\",(63,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$17$\", (70, 15));\n[/asy] Of the 100 people, $27+33+17=77$ people are accounted for, so the remaining 23 people must believe that fuchsia is ``purply'' but not ``kinda pink.''   [asy]\nlabel(\"kinda pink\", (2,75));\nlabel(\"purply\", (80,75));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$27$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$33$\",(28,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$23$\",(63,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$17$\", (70, 15));\n[/asy] The total number of people who think fuchsia is ``purply'' is $27+23=\\boxed{50}$."
