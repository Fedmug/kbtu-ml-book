    "problem": "How many one-fourths are there in $\\frac{7}{2}$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Asking \"how many one-fourths are there in 7/2?\" is the same as asking \"what is 7/2 divided by 1/4?\". Therefore, we want to find $$\\frac{7}{2} \\div \\frac{1}{4}.$$We remember that division by a fraction is the same thing as multiplication by its reciprocal. Also, we know that the reciprocal of $\\frac{1}{4}$ is $\\frac{4}{1}$. Therefore, we have that $$\\frac{7}{2} \\div \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 4}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{28}{2} = 14.$$There are $\\boxed{14}$ one-fourths in $\\frac{7}{2}$."
