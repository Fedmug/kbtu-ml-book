    "problem": "What is the least common multiple of 12, 18 and 30?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$12=2^2\\cdot3$, $18=2\\cdot3^2$, and $30=2\\cdot3\\cdot5$. The prime factorization of a number that is a multiple of these three numbers must have a 2 raised to at least the 2nd power, a 3 raised to at least the 2nd power, and a 5 raised to at least the 1st power. Thus, the $\\emph{least}$ common multiple is $2^2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5=\\boxed{180}$."
