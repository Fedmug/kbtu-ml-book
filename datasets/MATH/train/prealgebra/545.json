    "problem": "What is the greatest integer $x$ for which $\\frac79 > \\frac{x}{13}$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying both sides of the inequality by $13$, we have $\\frac{91}{9}>x$. The largest integer smaller than $\\frac{91}{9}$ is $\\boxed{10}$."
