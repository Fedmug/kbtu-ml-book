    "problem": "Tori's mathematics test had 75 problems: 10 arithmetic, 30 algebra, and 35 geometry problems. Although she answered $70\\%$ of the arithmetic, $40\\%$ of the algebra, and $60\\%$ of the geometry problems correctly, she did not pass the test because she got less than $60\\%$ of the problems right. How many more questions would she have needed to answer correctly to earn a $60\\%$ passing grade?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $70\\%(10)+40\\%(30)+60\\%(35)=7+12+21=40$, she answered 40 questions correctly. She needed $60\\%(75)=45$ to pass, so she needed $\\boxed{5}$ more correct answers."
