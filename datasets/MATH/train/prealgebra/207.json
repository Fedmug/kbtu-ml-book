    "solution": "Since the perimeter of the square is $48,$ its side length is $48 \\div 4 = 12.$\n\nSince the side length of the square is $12,$ its area is $12 \\times 12 = 144.$\n\nThe area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 48 \\times x = 24x.$\n\nSince the area of the triangle equals the area of the square, then $24x=144$ or $x=\\boxed{6}.$"
