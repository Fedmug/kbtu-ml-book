    "problem": "The value of $\\sqrt{73}$ is between two positive, consecutive integers. What is the product of these two integers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $73$ is between $64=8^{2}$ and $81=9^{2}$, we know that $\\sqrt{73}$ is between $8$ and $9.$ Our answer is $8\\cdot9=\\boxed{72}.$"
