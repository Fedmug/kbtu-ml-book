    "problem": "The product of two positive integers is 18. The positive difference of these two integers is 3. What is the sum of the two integers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "18 has 3 possible factorizations into pairs: $(1,18)$, $(2,9)$, and $(3,6)$. Only one of these, $(3,6)$, has difference 3, and it has sum $3+6=\\boxed{9}$."
