    "problem": "Seven points are marked on the circumference of a circle. How many different chords can be drawn by connecting two of these seven points?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We can choose two out of seven points (without regard to order) in $\\dfrac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21$ ways, so there are $\\boxed{21}$ chords."
