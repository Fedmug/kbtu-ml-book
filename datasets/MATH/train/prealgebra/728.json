    "problem": "Lily has $3$ gallons of milk and gives $\\frac{12}{5}$ gallons to James. What fraction of a gallon does she have left?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We want to subtract $\\frac{12}{5}$ from $3$. To do this, we get a common denominator of $5$. We get  $$3-\\frac{12}{5} = \\frac{15}{5}-\\frac{12}{5}=\\frac{15-12}{5}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}.$$"
