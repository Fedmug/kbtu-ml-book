    "problem": "How many degrees are in each interior angle of a regular hexagon?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the angle measures in a hexagon is $180(6-2) = 720$ degrees.  The angles of a regular hexagon are congruent, so each measures $720^\\circ/6 = \\boxed{120^\\circ}$."
