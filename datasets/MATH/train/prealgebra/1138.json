    "problem": "Jeremy's friend Steven will pay him $\\dfrac{11}{2}$ dollars for every room he cleans. Yesterday, Jeremy cleaned $\\dfrac{7}{3}$ rooms. How many dollars does Steven owe Jeremy? Leave your answer in fraction form.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since Steven owes $\\frac{11}{2}$ for each of the $\\frac73$ rooms, he owes $\\frac{11}{2}\\cdot \\frac73 = \\frac{11\\cdot 7}{2\\cdot 3} = \\boxed{\\frac{77}{6}}$ dollars."
