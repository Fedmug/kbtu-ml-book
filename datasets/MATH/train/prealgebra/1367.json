    "solution": "The total number of rounds played by all the golfers is $5(1)+2(2)+2(3)+3(4)+5(5) = 52$. The number of golfers is obtained by simply counting the dots; there are $5+2+2+3+5 = 17$. This means the average number of rounds played is $\\dfrac{52}{17}$, which is equal to $3\\dfrac{1}{17}$. The nearest whole number is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\nNotice that we can estimate the answer rather effectively, based on the fact that the table is nearly symmetrical around the middle value of $3$."
