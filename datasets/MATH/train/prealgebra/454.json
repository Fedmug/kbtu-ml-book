    "problem": "Piravena must make a trip from $A$ to $B$, then from $B$ to $C$, then from $C$ to $A$.  Each of these three parts of the trip is made entirely by bus or entirely by airplane.  The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of 3000 km from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of 3250 km from $A$. To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\\$100$ booking fee, plus $\\$0.10$ per kilometer. [asy]\n\npair A, B, C;\n\nC=(0,0);\n\nB=(0,1250);\n\nA=(3000,0);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--A);\n\nlabel(\"A\", A, SE);\n\nlabel(\"B\", B, NW);\n\nlabel(\"C\", C, SW);\n\nlabel(\"3000 km\", (A+C)/2, S);\n\nlabel(\"3250 km\", (A+B)/2, NE);\n\ndraw((0,125)--(125,125)--(125,0));\n\n[/asy] Determine the distance she travels for her complete trip.",

    "solution": "Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, then we may use the Pythagorean Theorem.\nThus, $AB^2=BC^2+CA^2$, and so  \\begin{align*}\nBC^2&=AB^2-CA^2\\\\\n&=3250^2-3000^2\\\\\n&=250^2(13^2-12^2)\\\\\n&=250^2(5^2)\\\\\n&=1250^2.\n\\end{align*} therefore $BC=1250$ km (since $BC>0$).\nPiravena travels a distance of $3250+1250+3000=\\boxed{7500}$ km for her complete trip."
