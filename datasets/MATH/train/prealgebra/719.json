    "problem": "The least common multiple of $x$, $10$ and $14$ is $70$. What is the greatest possible value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, we prime factorize the given numbers: \\[10=2\\cdot5, \\quad 14=2\\cdot7, \\quad 70=2\\cdot5\\cdot7.\\]  Since the least common multiple of $10$ and $14$ is already $70$ ($2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$), we can maximize $x$ by letting it be $\\boxed{70}$."
