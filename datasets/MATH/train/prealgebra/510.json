    "problem": "One US dollar is the equivalent of 7 Namibian dollars.  One US dollar is also the equivalent of 6 Chinese yuan. If a painting costs 105 Namibian dollars, how much would it cost in Chinese yuan?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since 7 Namibian dollars ($\\text{N}\\$$) is equal to 1 US dollar (USD), 105 Namibian dollars is equal to $\\text{N}\\$105\\left(\\dfrac{1\\;\\text{USD}}{\\text{N}\\$7}\\right) = 15\\;\\text{USD}$. Since 1 US dollar (USD) is equal to 6 Chinese yuan (CNY), 105 Namibian dollars is equal to 15 US dollars is equal to $15\\;\\text{USD}\\left(\\dfrac{6\\;\\text{CNY}}{1\\;\\text{USD}}\\right) = \\boxed{90}\\;\\text{yuan}$."
