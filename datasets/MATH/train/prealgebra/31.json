    "problem": "Find the smallest positive integer $x$ which is greater than $1$ and relatively prime to $120$ (recall that relatively prime means that the GCD of $x$ and $120$ is $1$)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We observe that the prime factorization of $120$ is equal to $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$.  It is a relatively quick matter to test that $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ share a prime factor with $120$, but $\\boxed{7}$ does not."
