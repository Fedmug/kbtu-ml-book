    "problem": "A recipe calls for $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour. If you only make half of the recipe, then how many cups of flour do you need? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To make half of the recipe, only half of the $4 \\frac{1}{2}$ cups of flour are needed. Since half of $4$ is $2$ and half of $\\frac{1}{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{4},$ we find that $\\boxed{2\\frac{1}{4}}$ cups of flour are needed."
