    "solution": "There are 20 square posts which are not on a corner, so there are $20/4=5$ square posts on each side, not including the corner posts.  Including the corner posts, there are 7 posts on a side, which means that there are 6 five-foot gaps between posts.  Altogether the length of a side is $7\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)+6(5)=32\\frac{1}{3}$ feet.  The perimeter of the square is four times the side length, so the perimeter is $4\\cdot 32\\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{129\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet."
