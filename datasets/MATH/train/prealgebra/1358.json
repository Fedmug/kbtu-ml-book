    "problem": "Moore's law says that the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on a silicon chip doubles every two years. In 1990, a typical CPU contained about $1,\\!000,\\!000$ transistors. According to Moore's law, how many transistors did a typical CPU contain in the year 2000?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$2000-1990 = 10$ years passed between the years $1990$ and $2000$, during which the number of transistors doubled $10 \\div 2 = 5$ times. Doubling a number five times means multiplying it by two raised to the fifth power. Thus we carry out the multiplication to get our answer: \\[1,\\!000,\\!000 \\cdot 2^5 = 1,\\!000,\\!000 \\cdot 32 = \\boxed{32,\\!000,\\!000} \\text{ transistors}.\\]"
