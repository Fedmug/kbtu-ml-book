    "problem": "A bag contains 5 red, 6 green, 7 yellow, and 8 blue jelly beans.   A jelly bean is selected at random.  What is the probability that it is blue?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In total, there are $5+6+7+8=26$ jelly beans in the bag.\n\nSince there are 8 blue jelly beans, the probability of selecting a blue jelly bean is  $$\\frac{8}{26}=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{13}}.$$"
