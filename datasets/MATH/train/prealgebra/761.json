    "problem": "The ''roundness'' of an integer greater than 1 is the sum of the exponents of the prime factorization of the number. For example, $20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1$, so 20 has a roundness of 3. What is the roundness of 1,000,000?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$1{,}000{,}000=10^6=(2\\cdot5)^6=2^6\\cdot5^6$. The roundness of 1,000,000 is therefore $6+6=\\boxed{12}$."
