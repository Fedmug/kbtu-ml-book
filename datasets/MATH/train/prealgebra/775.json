    "problem": "Express $1.\\overline{03}$ as a reduced fraction, given that $0.\\overline{01}$ is $\\frac{1}{99}$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that $1.\\overline{03} = 1 + 0.\\overline{03}$.  Since $0.\\overline{03}$ is three times greater than $0.\\overline{01}$, we have $0.\\overline{03} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{99} = \\frac{3}{99}$.  This simplifies to $\\frac{1}{33}$.  Then, adding one to this fraction, we get $1 + \\frac{1}{33} =$ $\\boxed{\\frac{34}{33}}$."
