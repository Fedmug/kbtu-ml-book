    "problem": "A frequency distribution of the scores for Mr. Sampson's algebra class is shown. What percent of the class received a score in the $60\\%$-$69\\%$ range? \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\nTest Scores & Frequencies\\\\\n\\hline\n$90\\% - 100\\%$& IIII\\\\\n$80\\% - 89\\%$& IIII IIII\\\\\n$70\\% - 79\\%$& IIII II\\\\\n$60\\% - 69\\%$ & IIII I\\\\\nBelow $60\\%$ & II\n\\end{tabular}",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We count the tallies to see that $5$ students scored in the $60\\%-69\\%$ range. Now we count tallies to find that there are $4+8+6+5+2=25$ students in the class. The percent of the class that received a score in the $60\\%-69\\%$ range is $\\frac{5}{25}\\times\\frac44=\\frac{20}{100}=\\boxed{20\\%}$."
