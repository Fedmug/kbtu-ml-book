    "problem": "What is the least positive whole number divisible by four different prime numbers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We take the four smallest primes: 2, 3, 5, 7. Their least common multiple is simply their product, so the least whole number divisible by four different primes is  $2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{210}$."
