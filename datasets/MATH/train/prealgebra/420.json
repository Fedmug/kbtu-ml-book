    "problem": "Find $\\frac{7}{17} - \\frac{4}{51}$. Reduce your answer to simplest form.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To subtract fractions, you must have a common denominator. In this case, since 51 is a multiple of 17, the common denominator is 51. So we get \\[\\frac{7\\cdot3}{17\\cdot3} - \\frac{4}{51} = \\frac{21}{51} - \\frac{4}{51}.\\]Using the distributive law, we can simplify this to \\[\\frac{21 - 4}{51} = \\frac{17}{51}.\\]But $\\frac{17}{51}$ can be written as $\\frac{17\\cdot1}{17\\cdot3}$, so our final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$."
