    "problem": "Bob is visiting Japan and he wants to buy a coffee for $200$ yen. If one U.S. dollar is worth $108$ yen, how much money, in USD to the nearest hundredth, does he have to spend for the coffee? (You may use a calculator on this problem.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Bob must pay $200$ yen, which we can multiply by the conversion factor $\\frac{1\\ \\text{USD}}{108\\ \\text{yen}}$ to obtain the value in U.S. dollars. Carrying out the calculation, we find that Bob must use $200\\ \\text{yen} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{USD}}{108\\ \\text{yen}} \\approx \\boxed{1.85\\ \\text{USD}}$ for the coffee."
