    "solution": "Since the smaller square has a perimeter of 4 cm and its sides are equal in length, each side measures $4/4=1$ cm. Since the larger square has area 16 square cm, each side measures $\\sqrt{16}=4$ cm. To find the length of $AB$, we draw a right triangle with $AB$ as the hypotenuse and the two sides parallel to the sides of the squares, as shown below: [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,10));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,2));\ndraw((0,2)--(2,2));\ndraw((0,2)--(12,10));\ndraw((12,0)--(12,10));\ndraw((2,10)--(12,10));\ndraw((0,2)--(12,2)--(12,10),dashed);\nlabel(\"B\",(0,2),W);\nlabel(\"A\",(12,10),E);[/asy] The horizontal side has length $1+4=5$ (the length of the smaller square and the length of the larger square added together) and the vertical side has length $4-1=3$ (the length of the larger square minus the length of the smaller square). Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the length of $AB$ is $\\sqrt{5^2+3^2}=\\sqrt{34}\\approx\\boxed{5.8}$ cm."
