    "problem": "A sign painter paints individual numerals for a row of 50 houses. The houses are numbered with consecutive integers from 1 to 50. How many 9s are painted?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "For every ten consecutive integers 1-10, 11-20, and so on until 50, there is one 9 painted. Since there are 5 sets of ten consecutive integers, there are $\\boxed{5}$ nines painted."
