    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We need to count the number of two-digit integers with odd tens digit and even units digit that are greater than $65.$ Notice that the only two possibilities for the tens digit are $7$ and $9.$ For each of these, the units digits $0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ and $8$ are all possible, for a total of $5$ choices. Therefore there are $2\\cdot 5=10$ possible integers to choose from. Since there are $10$ integers to choose from, the probability of selecting the right one is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}.$\n\nFor your information, the possible numbers are $$\\{ 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98 \\}.$$"
