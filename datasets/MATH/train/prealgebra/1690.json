    "problem": "Carolyn and Paul are playing a game starting with a list of the integers $1$ to $n.$ The rules of the game are:\n\n$\\bullet$  Carolyn always has the first turn.\n\n$\\bullet$  Carolyn and Paul alternate turns.\n\n$\\bullet$  On each of her turns, Carolyn must remove one number from the list such that this number has at least one positive divisor other than itself remaining in the list.\n\n$\\bullet$  On each of his turns, Paul must remove from the list all of the positive divisors of the number that Carolyn has just removed.\n\n$\\bullet$  If Carolyn cannot remove any more numbers, then Paul removes the rest of the numbers.\n\nFor example, if $n=6,$ a possible sequence of moves is shown in this chart:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nPlayer & Removed \\# & \\# remaining \\\\\n\\hline\nCarolyn & 4 & 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 \\\\\n\\hline\nPaul & 1, 2 & 3, 5, 6 \\\\\n\\hline\nCarolyn & 6 & 3, 5 \\\\\n\\hline\nPaul & 3 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\nCarolyn & None & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\nPaul & 5 & None \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\nNote that Carolyn can't remove $3$ or $5$ on her second turn, and can't remove any number on her third turn.\n\nIn this example, the sum of the numbers removed by Carolyn is $4+6=10$ and the sum of the numbers removed by Paul is $1+2+3+5=11.$\n\nSuppose that $n=6$ and Carolyn removes the integer $2$ on her first turn. Determine the sum of the numbers that Carolyn removes.",

    "solution": "The list starts as $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ $4,$ $5,$ $6.$\n\nIf Carolyn removes $2,$ then Paul removes the remaining positive divisor of $2$ (that is, $1$) to leave the list $3,$ $4,$ $5,$ $6.$ Carolyn must remove a number from this list that has at least one positive divisor other than itself remaining. The only such number is $6,$ so Carolyn removes $6$ and so Paul removes the remaining positive divisor of $6$ (that is, $3$), to leave the list $4,$ $5.$ Carolyn cannot remove either of the remaining numbers as neither has a positive divisor other than itself remaining.\n\nThus, Paul removes $4$ and $5.$\n\nIn summary, Carolyn removes $2$ and $6$ for a sum of $2+6=\\boxed{8}$ and Paul removes $1,$ $3,$ $4,$ and $5$ for a sum of $1+3+4+5=13.$"
