    "problem": "Angie's class has 2 girls for every 3 boys. If there are 20 students in the class, how many girls are in Angie's class?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If $2k$ is the number of girls in Angie's class, then $3k$ is the number of boys.  The total number of students is $2k+3k=5k$.  Solving $5k=20$ gives $k=4$, so there are $2(4)=\\boxed{8}$ girls in Angie's class."
