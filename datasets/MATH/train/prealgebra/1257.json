    "problem": "What is the length of the diagonal of a square with side length $50\\sqrt{2}$ cm? Express your answer in simplest form.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Drawing the diagonal of a square divides the square into two 45-45-90 triangles.  The diagonal is the hypotenuse of both triangles, and each leg of each triangle is a side of the square.  Since the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 triangle is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, the length of the diagonal of the square is \\[50\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt2 = 50\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2 = 50\\cdot 2 = \\boxed{100}.\\]"
