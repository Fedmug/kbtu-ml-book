    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The maximum number of points at which a line can intersect 1 circle is 2 distinct points.  Thus, for 3 circles, the maximum should be $3 \\times 2 = 6$ points at most.  If you're going for speed, you should probably guess 6 points at this point with a reasonable degree of certainty.  If you have time and want to be certain, you should only check for the existence of a line that intersects the three circles at $\\boxed{6}$ distinct points, because it is impossible that a line could intersect the circles at more than 6 points.  (There are, in fact, many lines that satisfy the conditions.)"
