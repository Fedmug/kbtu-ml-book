    "problem": "Find $1-0.\\overline{9}.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, we convert $0.\\overline{9}$ to fraction form. Let $a=0.\\overline{9}.$ Multiply both sides of this equation by $10$ to get $10a=9.\\overline{9}.$ Subtracting the left-hand sides $10a$ and $a$ as well as the right-hand sides $9.\\overline{9}$ and $0.\\overline{9}$ yields $9a=9$, which implies that $a=1.$ So, \\begin{align*}1-0.\\overline{9} &= 1-a\\\\ &= 1-1\\\\ &= \\boxed{0}.\\end{align*}"
