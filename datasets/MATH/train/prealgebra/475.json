    "problem": "What is the value of $x$ if \\begin{align*}x &= y+5,\\\\\ny &= z+10,\\\\\nz &= w+20,\\\\\n\\text{and }\\qquad w &= 80?\n\\end{align*}",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Plugging the known value of $w$ into the third given equation, we find that $z=100$. Plugging $z$ into the second given equation, we find that $y=110$. Plugging $y$ into the first given equation gives $x=\\boxed{115}$."
