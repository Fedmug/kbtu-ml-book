    "problem": "The area of a circle is $49\\pi$ square units. What is the radius of the circle, in units?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the area of a circle is $\\pi \\cdot r^2$, where $r$ is the radius, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot r^2 = 49\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find that $r=7$, so the radius is $\\boxed{7}$ units."
