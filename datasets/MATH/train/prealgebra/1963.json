    "problem": "A basement has a 24-foot by 32-foot rectangular floor. The basement is flooded with water to a depth of 18 inches. Three pumps are used to pump the water out of the basement.  Each  pump will pump 8 gallons of water per minute.  If a cubic foot of water contains 7.5 gallons, how many minutes will it take  to pump all of the water out of the basement using the three  pumps?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The height of the water initially in feet is $$(18 \\text{ inches})/(12 \\text{ inches/foot})=1.5\\text{ feet}.$$ The amount of water in the basement initially is $$1.5\\cdot24\\cdot32=1152\\text{ cubic feet}.$$ Converting this to gallons, we have $$(1152 \\text{ ft}^3)\\cdot(7.5 \\text { gallons/ft}^3)=8640 \\text{ gallons}.$$ If each pump can pump out 8 gallons of water per minute, then three pumps can pump out $8\\cdot3=24$ gallons a minute. So it will take $$(8640 \\text{ gallons})/(24 \\text{ gallons/minute})=\\boxed{360}$$ minutes to pump out all the water."
