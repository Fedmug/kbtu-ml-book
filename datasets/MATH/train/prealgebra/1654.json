    "problem": "Pizzas are sized by diameter. What percent increase in area results if Chantel's pizza increases from a 10-inch pizza to a 12-inch pizza?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the 10-inch pizza is $5^2\\pi = 25\\pi$ square inches, while the area of the 12-inch pizza is $6^2\\pi = 36\\pi$ square inches.  The increase is $36\\pi-25\\pi=11\\pi$. As a factor, this is an increase of $\\frac{11\\pi}{25\\pi} = \\frac{44}{100} = \\boxed{44\\%}$."
