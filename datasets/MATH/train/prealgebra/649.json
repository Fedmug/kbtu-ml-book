    "problem": "On an indoor circular track of circumference 50 feet, Joneal starts at point $S$, runs in a counterclockwise direction, and then stops when he has run exactly one mile (5280 feet). On which quarter of the circle, $A$, $B$, $C$ or $D$, did Joneal stop?\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\ndraw((-25,0)--(25,0));\ndraw((0,-25)--(0,25));\ndot((20,0));\nlabel(\"$S$\",(20,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(17,17),E);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(-17,17),W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-17,-17),W);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(17,-17),E);\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "Since 5250 is divisible by 50, Joneal is back at point $S$ after running 5250 feet.  For the next 12.5 feet, he is on the portion of the track marked $A$. For the next 12.5 feet after that, he is on the portion of the track marked $B$.  At this point he has traveled $5250+12.5+12.5=5275$ feet.  After traveling the final 5 feet, he is on the portion of the track marked $\\boxed{C}$."
