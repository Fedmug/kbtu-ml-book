    "problem": "Find one-fourth of 6 times 8.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that \"one-fourth of\" means the same thing as \"one-fourth times.\" So we are asked to find  \\[\n\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 6 \\cdot 8.\n\\]We then have \\[\n\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 =\\frac14\\cdot 48 = \\frac{48}{4} = 48\\div 4 =\\boxed{12}.\n\\]"
