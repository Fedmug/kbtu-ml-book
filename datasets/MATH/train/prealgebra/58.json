    "problem": "What is the sum of the positive odd divisors of $60$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $60$ is $60 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$. This means that the odd positive divisors of $60$ are the divisors of $3 \\cdot 5 = 15$ which are $1$, $3$, $5$, and $15$. The sum of these numbers is $1+3+5+15=\\boxed{24}$."
