    "problem": "How many integers between 1000 and 2000 have all three of the numbers 15, 20 and 25 as factors?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A number with 15, 20 and 25 as factors must be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM).  Because $15 = 3\n\\times 5$, $20 = 2^2 \\times 5$, and $25 = 5^2$, the LCM of 15, 20 and 25 is $2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 = 300$. There are $\\boxed{3}$ multiples of 300 between 1000 and 2000: 1200, 1500 and 1800."
