    "problem": "A suitcase lock has 3 dials with the digits $0, 1, 2,..., 9$ on each. How many different settings are possible if all three digits have to be different?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 10 possibilities for the first digit. After the first digit has been chosen, there are 9 possibilities for the second digit, and after the first two digits have been chosen there are 8 possibilities for the last digit. The total number of possible settings is $10\\cdot 9\\cdot 8=\\boxed{720}$."
