    "problem": "What is the smallest prime factor of 1821?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "1821 is clearly not even, so 2 is not a factor. We find that 3 is a factor, since the sum of the digits of 1821 is $1 + 8 + 2 + 1 = 12$, which is divisible by 3. Since we want the smallest prime factor, we are done; our answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
