    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Subtracting $1$ from each expression, we have $-5\\le 2x\\le 5$. Dividing by $2$, we get $-\\frac52\\le x\\le \\frac52$. The integers satisfying this chain of inequalities are $-2,-1,0,1,2$. There are $\\boxed{5}$ numbers in this list."
