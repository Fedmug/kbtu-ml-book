    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ is an isosceles right triangle with the measure of angle $A$ equal to 90 degrees. The length of segment $AC$ is 6 cm. What is the area of triangle $ABC$, in square centimeters?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the triangle is isosceles, the length of $AB$ is also 6cm. The area of the triangle is then $(AB\\cdot AC)/2=(6\\cdot6)/2=\\boxed{18}$ square centimeters."
