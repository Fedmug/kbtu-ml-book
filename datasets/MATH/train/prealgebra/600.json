    "problem": "In triangle $ABC$, the measure of $\\angle A$ is $86$ degrees. The measure of $\\angle B$ is $22$ degrees more than three times the measure of $\\angle C$. What is the measure, in degrees, of $\\angle C$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In a triangle, the degrees of the three angles add up to $180$. We set the degree measure for $\\angle C$ to be $x$. Therefore, the angle measure for $\\angle B$ is $3x+22$. We add all of the degrees together to $180$. Then we have: \\begin{align*}\n86+3x+22+x &= 180 \\\\\n108+4x &= 180 \\\\\n4x &= 72 \\\\\nx &= 18.\n\\end{align*} Therefore, we have that the degree measure of $\\angle C$ is $\\boxed{18 \\text{ degrees}}$."
