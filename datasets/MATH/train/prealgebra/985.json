    "problem": "The measures of the three interior angles of a triangle are $50^\\circ$, $55^\\circ$ and $x^\\circ$. What is the degree measure of the largest interior angle of this triangle?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that the interior angles of a triangle sum to $180^\\circ$, so $50^\\circ + 55^\\circ + x^\\circ = 180^\\circ$. It follows that $x = 75$. Thus, this triangle has angles of $50^\\circ$, $55^\\circ$, and $75^\\circ$. The largest of these three angles is $\\boxed{75^\\circ}$."
