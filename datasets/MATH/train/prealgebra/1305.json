    "problem": "The Gauss family has three boys aged $7,$ a girl aged $14,$ and a boy aged $15.$ What is the mean (average) of the ages of the children?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The children in the Gauss family have ages $7,$ $7,$ $7,$ $14,$ $15.$ The mean of their ages is thus $$\\frac{7+7+7+14+15}{5} = \\frac{50}{5}=\\boxed{10}.$$"
