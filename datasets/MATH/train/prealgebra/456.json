    "problem": "What is the perimeter, in cm, of quadrilateral $ABCD$ if $\\overline{AB} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, $\\overline{DC} \\perp \\overline{BC}$, $AB=9$ cm, $DC=4$ cm, and $BC=12$ cm?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the given segments are perpendicular, we have two consecutive right angles. Since $AB\\ne DC$, we know the quadrilateral is not a rectangle. After drawing the three given sides connected by two right angles, we connect $A$ and $D$ to create a trapezoid. If we extend $\\overline{DC}$ to complete the rectangle, we create a right triangle to help find the length of $\\overline{AD}$. We had to extend $\\overline{DC}$ by 5 units since $\\overline{AB}$ is 5 units longer than $\\overline{DC}$. The bottom leg of the triangle is the same length as $\\overline{BC}$ since they are opposite sides of a rectangle. So we have a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12. We could use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the length of the hypotenuse, or we recognize that 5 and 12 are part of the Pythagorean triple $(5,12,13)$. So the length of the hypotenuse $\\overline{AD}$ is 13 units. That makes the perimeter $9+12+4+13=\\boxed{38}$ centimeters.\n\nAlternatively, instead of extending $\\overline{DC}$, we could have split the trapezoid into a $4\\times12$ rectangle on top and a $(5,12,13)$ right triangle on the bottom.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.6 cm);\n\npen sm=fontsize(9);\npair A=(0,0), B=(0, 9), C=(12, 9), D=(12, 5), E=(12,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(A--E--D);\nlabel(\"A\", A, SW, sm);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NW, sm);\nlabel(\"C\", C, NE, sm);\nlabel(\"D\", D, dir(0), sm);\nlabel(\"$9$\", (A+B)/2, W, sm);\nlabel(\"$12$\", (B+C)/2, N, sm);\nlabel(\"$4$\", (C+D)/2, dir(0), sm);\nlabel(\"$5$\", (D+E)/2, dir(0), sm);\nlabel(\"$12$\", (A+E)/2, S, sm);\nlabel(\"$13$\", (A+D)/2, N, sm);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,20));\ndraw(rightanglemark(B,C,D,20));\ndraw(rightanglemark(D,E,A,20));\n[/asy]"
