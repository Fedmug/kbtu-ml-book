    "problem": "What is the least positive multiple of 21 that is greater than 380?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing 380 by 21 gives a quotient of 18 with a remainder of 2. Therefore, $21 \\cdot 18$ is the largest multiple of 21 that is less than or equal to 380, and $21 \\cdot 19 = \\boxed{399}$ is the least positive multiple of 21 that is greater than 380."
