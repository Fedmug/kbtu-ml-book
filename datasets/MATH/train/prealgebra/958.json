    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To get from 6 to 72 we multiply by 12, so a fraction equivalent to $\\frac{5}{6}$ whose denominator is 72 has a numerator of $n=5 \\cdot12=60$.  We can solve $\\frac{5}{6}=\\frac{60+m}{84}$ similarly to obtain $m=10$.  Finally, $\\frac{5}{6}=\\frac{p-10}{120}\\implies p-10=100 \\implies p=\\boxed{110}$."
