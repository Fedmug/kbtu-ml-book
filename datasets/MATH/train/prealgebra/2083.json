    "problem": "What is the largest multiple of $9$ which is smaller than $-70$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing $-70$ by $9$ gives $-8$ with a remainder of $2$, or $$-70 = -8 \\cdot 9 + 2.$$Thus, $-8 \\cdot 9 = \\boxed{-72}$ is the largest multiple of $9$ which is smaller than $-70$."
