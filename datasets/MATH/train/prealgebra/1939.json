    "problem": "What is the smallest positive multiple of $32$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Every positive multiple of $32$ is $32\\cdot x$ for some positive integer $x$. The smallest multiple is therefore going to be when $x$ is the smallest positive integer which is $1$. So, $32\\cdot1=\\boxed{32}$ is the smallest multiple of $32$."
