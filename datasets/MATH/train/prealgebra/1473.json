    "problem": "Kenton watched 2000 adult men and women board a cruise ship. Half of the adults were women. If 20$\\%$ of the women and 9$\\%$ of the men were wearing sunglasses, what was the total number of men and women wearing sunglasses?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since half the adults were women, there are 1000 women and 1000 men.  Thus, $20\\%$ of 1000 is 200 women wearing sunglasses, and $9\\%$ of 1000 means there are 90 men wearing sunglasses, making for a total of $\\boxed{290}$ people wearing sunglasses."
