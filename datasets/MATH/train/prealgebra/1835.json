    "problem": "I run at a constant pace, and it takes me 18 minutes to run to the store from my house. If the store is 2 miles away, and my friend's house is 1 mile away from my house, how many minutes will it take me to run from my house to my friend's house?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since I run at a constant pace, we can set up a proportion with one unknown: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\text{minutes}}{\\text{distance}}&=\\frac{\\text{minutes}}{\\text{distance}}\\\\\n\\frac{x}{1\\text{ mi}}&=\\frac{18\\text{ min}}{2\\text{ mi}}\\\\\nx&=\\frac{18\\text{ min}}{2\\text{ mi}}\\cdot 1\\text{ mi}\\\\\nx&=\\frac{18\\text{ min}}{2}=9\\text{ min}\\\\\nx&=\\boxed{9\\text{ min}}.\n\\end{align*}"
