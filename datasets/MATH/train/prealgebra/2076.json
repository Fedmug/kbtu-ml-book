    "problem": "A rectangular tile measures 3 inches by 4 inches. What is the fewest number of these tiles that are needed to completely cover a rectangular region that is 2 feet by 5 feet?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the floor in square feet $5 \\cdot 2 = 10$. Each tile has an area in square feet of $\\left ( \\dfrac{1}{4} \\right ) \\left ( \\dfrac{1}{3} \\right ) =\n\\dfrac{1}{12}$, so the minimum number of tiles is $\\dfrac{10}{\\left( \\frac{1}{12} \\right)} = \\boxed{120}.$"
