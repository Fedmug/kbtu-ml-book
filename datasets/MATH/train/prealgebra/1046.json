    "problem": "The degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n$ sides is 1800. What is the degree measure of the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with $n + 2$ sides?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the measures of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180^\\circ(n-2)$.  Therefore,  \\[\n180(n-2)=1800 \\implies n=12.\n\\] So $n+2=14$, and the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a 14-gon is $180^\\circ(14-2)=\\boxed{2160}$ degrees."
