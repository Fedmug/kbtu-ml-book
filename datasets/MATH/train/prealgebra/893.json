    "problem": "The number of inches in the perimeter of a square is equal to the number of square inches in its area. Find the length, in inches, of a side of the square.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the side length of the square be $x$. Then, the perimeter is $4x$ and the area is $x^2$. We're given that \\[4x=x^2;\\]solving yields $x=4$. Thus, the side length of the square is $\\boxed{4}$ inches."
