    "solution": "The two small squares on the left-hand side both have side length $1$, so both have area $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. The larger square on the right has side length twice that of one of the smaller squares, giving it a side length of $2$ and an area of $4$. Thus, the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $1 + 1 + 4 = \\boxed{6}$ square inches."
