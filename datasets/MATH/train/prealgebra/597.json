    "problem": "In Idaho, 472 people were asked what they call soft drinks. The results of the survey are shown in the pie chart. The central angle of the ``Pop'' sector of the graph is $251^\\circ$, to the nearest whole degree. How many of the people surveyed chose ``Pop''? Express your answer as a whole number.\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(150);\nreal w = 10pt,linew = 1;\nfilldraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,251)--(0,0)--cycle,gray(.4),black+linewidth(linew));\nfilldraw(Arc((0,0),1,251,280)--(0,0)--cycle,white,black+linewidth(linew));\nfilldraw(Arc((0,0),1,280,350)--(0,0)--cycle,gray(.7),black+linewidth(linew));\nfilldraw(Arc((0,0),1,350,360)--(0,0)--cycle,white,black+linewidth(linew));\nlabel(\"\\textbf{POP}\",expi(2.19),expi(2.19),fontsize(w));\nlabel(\"\\textbf{COKE}\",expi(4.63),expi(4.63),fontsize(w));\nlabel(\"\\textbf{SODA}\",expi(5.50),expi(5.50),fontsize(w));\nlabel(\"\\textbf{OTHER}\",expi(6.20),expi(6.20),fontsize(w));[/asy]",

    "solution": "We want to find the fraction of people that chose ``Pop\". To this end, we find the fraction of the circle that represents ``Pop\", $\\frac{251}{360}$, and multiply by the total number of people surveyed: $472 \\cdot \\frac{251}{360} \\approx 329.089$. Rounding to a whole number gives a possible answer of $329$ people.\n\nThis method doesn't prove that the answer is unique, but we can check that $328$ people would take up only $\\frac{328}{472}\\cdot 360 \\approx 250.169$ degrees of the pie chart, while $330$ people would take up $\\frac{330}{472}\\cdot 360 \\approx 251.695$ degrees. So, $\\boxed{329}$ people are the only number whose share of the pie rounds to the nearest degree as $251^\\circ$."
