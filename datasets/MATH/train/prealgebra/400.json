    "problem": "Find the smallest, positive four-digit multiple of $15.$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing $1000$ by $15$ gives a quotient of $66$ with a remainder of $10.$ In other words, \\[1000=15\\cdot66+10.\\]So, $66\\cdot15$ is the largest three-digit multiple of $15,$ and $67\\cdot15=\\boxed{1005}$ is the smallest four-digit multiple."
