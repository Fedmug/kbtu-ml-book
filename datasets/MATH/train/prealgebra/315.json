    "problem": "Jori has 2 gallons of distilled water and uses 7/6 gallon in a science experiment. What fraction of a gallon does she have left?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We want to subtract 7/6 from 2. To do this, we get a common denominator of 6. We get \\[\n2-\\frac{7}{6} = \\frac{12}{6}-\\frac{7}{6}=\\frac{12-7}{6}=\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}.\n\\]"
