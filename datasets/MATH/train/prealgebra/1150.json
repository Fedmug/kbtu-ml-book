    "problem": "How many odd integers are there between $\\frac{17}{4}$ and $\\frac{35}{2}?$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We note that $$\\frac{17}{4} = 4\\frac{1}{4} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\frac{35}{2} = 17\\frac{1}{2}.$$Therefore, the integers between these two numbers are the integers from $5$ to $17,$ inclusive. The odd integers in this range are $5,$ $7,$ $9,$ $11,$ $13,$ $15,$ and $17,$ of which there are $\\boxed{7}.$"
