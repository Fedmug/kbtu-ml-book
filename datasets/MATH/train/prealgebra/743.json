    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First we simplify $\\frac{8}{10}$, \\[\n\\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{2}{2}\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}=1\\cdot\\frac{4}{5} =\\frac{4}{5}.\n\\]Now make both terms have a common denominator, \\[\n\\frac{2}{7}+\\frac{4}{5}= \\frac{5}{5}\\cdot\\frac{2}{7}+\\frac{7}{7}\\cdot\\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{10}{35}+\\frac{28}{35}\n=\\boxed{\\frac{38}{35}}.\n\\]Note that we could have done the problem without simplifying $\\frac{8}{10}$ at the beginning and instead simplified at the end, but in this case simplifying first made things simpler as we didn't need to carry around the extra factor of two."
