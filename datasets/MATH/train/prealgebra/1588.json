    "problem": "The product of three different positive integers is equal to $7^3$. What is the sum of the three integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "All three integers must be divisors of $7^3$.  The only divisors of $7^3$ are $7^0$, $7^1$, $7^2$, $7^3$.  We have $7^3=7^0\\times7^1\\times7^2$. Thus our answer is $7^0+7^1+7^2=1+7+49=\\boxed{57}$."
