    "solution": "Since the square has side length $2/\\pi$,  the diameter of each circular section is $2/\\pi$. The boundary of the region consists of  4 semicircles, whose total perimeter is twice the circumference of a  circle having  diameter $2/\\pi$. Hence the perimeter of the region is \\[\n2\\cdot \\left(\\pi\\cdot \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right) = \\boxed{4}.\n\\]"
