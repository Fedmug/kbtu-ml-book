    "solution": "The area of the entire grid in the diagram is 38.  (We can obtain this either by counting the individual squares, or by dividing the grid into a 2 by 3 rectangle, a 3 by 4 rectangle, and a 4 by 5 rectangle.)\n\nThe area of shaded region is equal to the area of the entire grid minus the area of the unshaded triangle, which is right-angled with a base of 12 and a height of 4. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is $$38 - \\frac{1}{2}(12)(4)=38-24=\\boxed{14}.$$"
