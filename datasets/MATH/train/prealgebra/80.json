    "problem": "Of the numbers $\\frac{7}{10}, \\frac{4}{5}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$, which number is the arithmetic mean of the other two?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The arithmetic mean must be between the other two numbers, so we find the middle quantity by putting the fractions in a comparable form. We have $\\frac{7}{10}, \\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{8}{10}, \\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{7.5}{10}$. The middle quantity is $\\frac{7.5}{10}$, so the arithmetic mean is $\\boxed{\\frac34}$. Our answer makes sense since $7.5$ is the arithmetic mean of $7$ and $8$."
