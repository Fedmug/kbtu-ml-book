    "problem": "What is the product of the two largest one-digit primes and the largest two-digit prime?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The two largest one-digit primes are 5 and 7; the largest two-digit prime is 97 (98 and 99 are both composite).  The product of these three primes is $5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 97 = 35 \\cdot 97 = 35(100-3)=3500-105=\\boxed{3395}$."
