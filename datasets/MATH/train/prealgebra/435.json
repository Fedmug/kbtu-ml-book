    "problem": "A square has two diagonals, and a convex pentagon has five diagonals.  How many diagonals does a convex decagon have?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A convex $n$-gon has $\\frac{n(n-3)}{2}$ diagonals. Thus, a convex decagon has $\\frac{10\\cdot 7}{2} = \\boxed{35}$ diagonals."
