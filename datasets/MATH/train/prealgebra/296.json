    "problem": "What is the largest multiple of 7 less than 50?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing 50 by 7 will give us an answer of 7 with a remainder of 1. $$50=7\\cdot 7 +1$$Because the answer must be less than 50, $7\\cdot 7=\\boxed{49}$ must be our answer."
