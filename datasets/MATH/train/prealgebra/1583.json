    "problem": "Two complementary angles are in a ratio of $3:2$. What is the measure, in degrees, of the smaller angle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the measure of the larger angle be $3x$.  Then the measure of the smaller angle is $2x$, and because the angles are complementary we have $3x+2x=90^\\circ$.  It follows that $x=90^\\circ/5=18^\\circ$, so the measure of the smaller angle is $2x=\\boxed{36}$ degrees."
