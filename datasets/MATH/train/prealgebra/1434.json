    "problem": "The perimeter of a particular square and the circumference of a particular circle are equal. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $s$ be the side length of the square and $r$ the radius of the circle.  We are given $4s=2\\pi r$ and asked to find $s^2/(\\pi r^2)$.  Squaring both sides of the equation we obtain $16s^2=4\\pi^2r^2$.  We divide by $16\\pi r^2$ to find $s^2/(\\pi r^2)=\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}$."
