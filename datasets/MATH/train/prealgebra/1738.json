    "problem": "The area of a square plot of land is 325 square meters. What is the perimeter of the square, in meters? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If $s$ is the side of the square, $s^2 = 325$, so $s = \\sqrt{325} = \\sqrt{65 \\cdot 5} = \\sqrt{13 \\cdot 25} = 5\\sqrt{13}$. The perimeter is $4s$, or $\\boxed{20\\sqrt{13}}$."
