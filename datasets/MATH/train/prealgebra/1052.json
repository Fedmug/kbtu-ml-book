    "solution": "Since square $A$ has a perimeter of 24 cm and all its sides are equal in length, each side measures $24/4=6$ cm. The area of square $A$ is thus $6\\cdot6=36$ square cm. Thus, the area of square $B$ is $36/4=9$ square cm. So each side of square $B$ measures $\\sqrt{9}=3$ cm. Finally, the perimeter of square $B$ is $4\\cdot3=\\boxed{12}$ cm."
