    "problem": "Square A has side lengths each measuring $x$ inches.  Square B  has side lengths each measuring $4x$ inches.  What is the ratio of  the area of the smaller square to the area of the larger square?   Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the smaller square is $x\\cdot x=x^2$ square inches. The area of the larger square is $4x\\cdot4x=16x^2$ square inches. The ratio of the areas is $x^2/(16x^2)=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{16}}$."
