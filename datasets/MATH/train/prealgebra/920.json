    "problem": "If 20$\\%$ of 10$\\%$ of a number is 12, what is 10$\\%$ of 20$\\%$ of the same number?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$20\\%$ of a number is the same as multiplying by .2, and $10\\%$ of a number is the same as multiplying by .1.  Since a percent of a percent is simply multiplying two decimals, it does not matter what order we take the percentages - it will be the same result.  Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{12}$."
