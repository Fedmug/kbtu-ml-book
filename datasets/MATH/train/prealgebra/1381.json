    "problem": "What is the smallest integer $x$ for which $x<2x-7$ ?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Adding $7$ and subtracting $x$ from both sides of the inequality, we have that $7<x$. The smallest value $x$ that satisfies this inequality is $x = \\boxed{8}$."
