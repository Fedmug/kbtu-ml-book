    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of all two-digit palindromes?  (Note: A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards as backwards.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Palindromes are numbers whose digits read from left to right and from right to left result in the same number. All two-digit palindromes (11, 22,...99) can be factored into 11 and a number between 1 and 9. The only factor that all of them share is $\\boxed{11}$, so that is our answer."
