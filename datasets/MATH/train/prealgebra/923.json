    "solution": "To express the number $0.4\\overline{5}$ as a fraction, we call it $x$ and subtract it from $10x$: $$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&10x &=& 4&.55555\\ldots \\\\\n- &x &=& 0&.45555\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&9x &=& 4&.1\n\\end{array}$$ This shows that $0.4\\overline{5} = \\frac{4.1}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{41}{90}}$."
