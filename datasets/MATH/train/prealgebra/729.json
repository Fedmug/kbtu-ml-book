    "problem": "Margaret started a stamp collection. She collected 8 stamps the first day. Each subsequent day she collected 8 more stamps than she had collected the previous day. If she collected stamps for 5 consecutive days, what was the average number of stamps collected per day?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Consider the sequence 8, 16, 24, $\\ldots$ of the numbers of stamps collected by Margaret on successive days.  The mean of an arithmetic sequence is equal to its median, so the mean of this five-term arithmetic sequence is equal to the third term $\\boxed{24}$."
