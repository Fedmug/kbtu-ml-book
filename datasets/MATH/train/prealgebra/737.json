    "problem": "The distance from Goteborg to Jonkiping on a map is 88 cm. The scale on the map is 1 cm: 15 km. How far is it between the two city centers, in kilometers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If one centimeter on the map is 15 kilometers in reality, then we have the ratio $1 \\text{ cm on map} : 15 \\text{ km in reality}$. Multiplying the ratio by 88, we get $88 \\text{ cm on map} : 15 \\cdot 88 \\text{ km in reality} =88 \\text{ cm on map} : 1320 \\text{ km in reality}$. Thus, the cities are $\\boxed{1320}$ kilometers apart."
