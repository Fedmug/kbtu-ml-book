    "problem": "The hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is $4\\sqrt{2}$ units. How many square units are in the area of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, so each leg of the triangle has length 4.  Therefore, the area of the triangle is $(4)(4)/2 = \\boxed{8}$ square units."
