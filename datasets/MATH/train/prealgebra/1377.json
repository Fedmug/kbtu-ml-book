    "problem": "Two students are having a pie eating contest. The first student eats $\\frac{6}{7}$ of one pie. The second student eats $\\frac{3}{4}$ of one pie. How much more pie did the first student finish than the second student? Express your answer as a fraction of one pie, reduced to simplest form.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We want to subtract $\\frac{3}{4}$ from $\\frac{6}{7}$. To do this, we first put the two fractions over a common denominator. Since the least common multiple of $4$ and $7$ is $28$, we write $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{7}{7} = \\frac{21}{28}$ and $\\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{4}{4} = \\frac{24}{28}$, so our difference is: $$\\frac{6}{7} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{24}{28} - \\frac{21}{28} = \\frac{24-21}{28} = \\frac{3}{28}.$$Therefore, the first student ate $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{28}}$ more of the pie than the second student."
