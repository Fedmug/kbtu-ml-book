    "problem": "Koalas absorb only $25\\%$ of the fiber they eat. A koala absorbed 10.5 ounces of fiber in one day. How many ounces of fiber did he eat that day?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We seek the answer to the question \"10.5 ounces is 25% of what number?\" If we call the unknown number of ounces $x$, we have the equation $10.5=0.25x$. Dividing both sides by $0.25$, we have $x=\\frac{10.5}{0.25}=\\boxed{42}$ ounces of fiber."
