    "problem": "A storm in Sydney, Australia, caused $\\$$30 million in damage. That estimate was in Australian dollars. At that time, 1.5 Australian dollars were worth 1 American dollar. Determine the number of American dollars of damage the storm caused.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since 1.5 Australian dollars are worth 1 American dollar, 1 Australian dollar is worth $\\dfrac{1}{1.5}=\\dfrac{2}{3}$ American dollars. Therefore, the number of American dollars of damage was $$\\left( \\dfrac{2}{3} \\right) (30,\\!000,\\!000)=\\boxed{20,\\!000,\\!000}.$$"
