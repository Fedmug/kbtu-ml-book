    "problem": "Suppose that $x$ is a positive multiple of $3$. If $x$ cubed is less than $1000$, what is the greatest possible value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Ten cubed is 1000, so we know that $x$ must be less than $10$. Because $9$ is the greatest multiple of $3$ that is less than $10$, $\\boxed{9}$ is the greatest possible value of $x$."
