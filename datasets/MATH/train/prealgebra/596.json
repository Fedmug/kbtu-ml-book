    "solution": "We can count the total number of triangles that can be chosen directly, by listing them: $AEC$, $AEB$, $BED$, $BEC$, and $BDC$. Of these, the triangles with a part shaded are $AEC$, $BEC$, and $BDC$. So there is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$ probability of selecting a triangle with all or part of its interior shaded."
