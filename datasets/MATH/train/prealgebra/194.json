    "problem": "The perimeter of a square with side length $x$ units is equal to the circumference of a circle with radius 2 units. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The perimeter of a square with side length $x$ units is $4x$ units.  The circumference of a circle with radius 2 units is $2\\pi (\\text{radius})=2\\pi(2)=4\\pi$ units.  Setting $4x=4\\pi$, we find $x=\\pi$.  To two decimal places, $\\pi=\\boxed{3.14}$."
