    "problem": "$24$ lemons are required to make $32$ gallons of lemonade. How many lemons are needed to make $4$ gallons of lemonade?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The proportion of lemons to gallons of lemonade must always remain constant. Thus, $\\frac{24}{32} = \\frac{x}{4}$, where $x$ is the number of lemons required to make $4$ gallons of lemonade. $\\frac{24}{32}$ simplifies to $\\frac{3}{4}$, so we have $\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{x}{4}$. Therefore, $x = 3$. So, $\\boxed{3}$ lemons are needed to make $4$ gallons of lemonade."
