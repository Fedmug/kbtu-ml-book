    "problem": "What is $4\\cdot 6+8\\cdot 3-28\\div 2$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that multiplication and division should be done in order from left to right before addition and subtraction.  We have \\begin{align*}4\\cdot 6+8\\cdot 3-28\\div 2&=24+24-14.\\end{align*}  Now, we rewrite the subtraction as the addition of a negation so that we can use the properties of addition to rearrange the numbers and make the arithmetic easier.  We get \\begin{align*}24+24-14&=24+24+(-14) \\\\ &=24+(-14)+24 \\\\ &=24-14+24 \\\\ &=10+24 \\\\ &=\\boxed{34}.\\end{align*}"
