    "solution": "At the 2007 Math Olympics, Canada won $17$ of $100$ possible medals, or $0.17$ of the possible medals. We convert each of the possible answers to a decimal and see which is closest to $0.17:$ \\[\\frac{1}{4}=0.25 \\quad\n\\frac{1}{5}=0.2 \\quad\n\\frac{1}{6}=0.166666... \\quad\n\\frac{1}{7}=0.142857... \\quad\n\\frac{1}{8}=0.125 \\]The choice that is closest to $0.17$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}.$"
