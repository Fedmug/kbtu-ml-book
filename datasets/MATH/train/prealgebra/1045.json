For example, if you think A and C are the true statements, then answer ``A,C\" (without the quote marks).",

    "solution": "We divide each number in the sum by $32$ to get the following equalities:   \\begin{align*}\n64 &= 32 \\cdot 2\\\\\n96 &= 32 \\cdot 3\\\\\n128 &= 32 \\cdot 4\\\\\n160 &= 32 \\cdot 5\\\\\n288 &= 32 \\cdot 9\\\\\n352 &= 32 \\cdot 11\\\\\n3232 &= 32 \\cdot 101.\n\\end{align*} These equations tell us that each of the numbers in the sum is a multiple of $32$. A sum of multiples of $32$ is a multiple of $32$, so $x$ is a multiple of $32$. It follows that D is true.\n\nRecall that, for integers $x$, $y$, and $z$, if $x$ is a factor of $y$ and $y$ is a factor of $z$, then $x$ is a factor of $z$. Note that      $$32 = 4 \\cdot 8 = 16 \\cdot 2,$$ so $4$, $8$, and $16$ are factors of $32$. We already showed $32$ is a factor of $x$, so $4$, $8$, and $16$ must also be factors of $x$. It follows that statements A, B, and C are also true.\n\nWe have shown that all the statements are true, so our final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A,B,C,D}}$."
