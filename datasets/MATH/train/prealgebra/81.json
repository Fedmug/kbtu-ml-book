    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the square is $s^2$.  Since the sides of the square all have the same length, the base of the triangle is $s$ (for the height drawn).  Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac12 sh$. Since these areas are equal, we have \\[\\frac12sh=s^2.\\] Dividing both sides by $s$ and multiplying both sides by 2 gives $h = \\boxed{2s}$."
