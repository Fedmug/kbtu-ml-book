    "problem": "What is the greatest common divisor of 128, 144 and 480?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$128=2^7$ and $144=12^2=2^4 \\cdot 3^2,$ so the greatest common divisor of the three numbers is at most $2^4=16$. In fact, $480$ is divisible by $16,$ so $\\boxed{16}$ is the greatest common divisor of the three numbers."
