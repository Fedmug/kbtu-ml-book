    "problem": "What is the measure of an angle, in degrees, if its supplement is six times its complement?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Call the angle measure $x$. We are given that $180^{\\circ}-x=6(90^{\\circ}-x)$. This expands to $180^{\\circ}-x=540^{\\circ}-6x$ or $5x=360^{\\circ}$ and $x=\\boxed{72^{\\circ}}$."
