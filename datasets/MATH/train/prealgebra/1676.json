    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that $\\frac{a}{b}$ means the same as $a \\div b.$ Applying this rule with $a=3$ and $b=6/11$, we get \\[\n\\frac{3}{\\frac{6}{11}} = 3\\div \\frac{6}{11}.\n\\] Now remember that dividing by a number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, and the reciprocal of $\\frac{6}{11}$ is $\\frac{11}{6}$. We get \\[\n3 \\div \\frac{6}{11} = 3\\cdot \\frac{11}{6} = \\frac{3\\cdot 11}{6} = \\frac{3}{6} \\cdot 11 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 11 =\\boxed{\\frac{11}{2}}.\n\\]"
