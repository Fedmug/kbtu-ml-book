    "problem": "Alexia designed a logo 2 inches wide and 1.5 inches tall to be used on her school's notebooks. The school wants the logo on the notebook to be 8 inches wide. How tall, in inches, will it be if it is enlarged proportionately?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If the width goes from 2 inches to 8 inches, it has been multiplied by 4.  If the picture is enlarged proportionately, then the height will also be multiplied by 4.  Therefore, the enlarged logo is $1.5\\times4=\\boxed{6}$ inches tall."
