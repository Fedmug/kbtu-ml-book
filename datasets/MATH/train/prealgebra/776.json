    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Recall that $(-a)^n= a^n$ when $n$ is an even integer and $-a^n$ when $n$ is an odd integer. In particular, when $a=1$ this identity tells us that $(-1)^n = 1$ when $n$ is even and $-1$ when $n$ is odd. This includes $(-1)^0 = 1.$  So the sum in question becomes \\[\n1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + \\cdots + 1 + (-1) + 1.\n\\]Since $1 + (-1)=0$, we can add these numbers up in pairs to get  \\[\n\\underbrace{1 + (-1)}_0 + \\underbrace{1 + (-1)}_0 + \\cdots + \\underbrace{1 + (-1)}_0 + 1 = 0 + 0 + \\cdots + 0 + 1 = \\boxed{1}.\n\\]"
