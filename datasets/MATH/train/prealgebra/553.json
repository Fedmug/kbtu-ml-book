    "problem": "A right triangle has legs measuring 20 inches and 21 inches. What is the length of the hypotenuse, in inches?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Say the hypotenuse has length $h$ inches. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $h^2=20^2+21^2=400+441=841$, so $h=\\sqrt{841}=29$. The length is thus $\\boxed{29}$ inches."
