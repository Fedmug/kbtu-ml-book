    "problem": "Fully simplify the following expression: $[(2+3+4+5)\\div2] + [(2\\cdot5+8)\\div3]$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "By the order of operations, first simplify the expressions inside of each of the brackets. The first one, $[(2+3+4+5)\\div2]$ is equal to $14\\div2$.\n\nThe second bracket can also be simplified through the use of the order of operations.   \\[\n(2\\cdot5+8)\\div3 = 18\\div3 = 6.\n\\]  Therefore,    \\[\n[(2+3+4+5)\\div2] + [(2\\cdot5+8)\\div3] = [7] + [6] = 7+6 = \\boxed{13}.\n\\]"
