    "problem": "A triangle has a side of length 6 cm, a side of length 8 cm and a right angle. What is the shortest possible length of the remaining side of the triangle? Express your answer in centimeters as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The remaining side is minimized if it is a leg of the triangle rather than the hypotenuse.  Then its length is $\\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = 2\\sqrt 7\\approx \\boxed{5.29}$ cm."
