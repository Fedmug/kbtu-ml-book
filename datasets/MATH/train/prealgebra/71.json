    "problem": "If $15\\%$ of $N$ is $45\\%$ of 2003, what is the value of $N$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiply both sides of the equation \\[\n\\frac{15}{100}N=\\frac{45}{100}(2003)\n\\] by 20 to find that $3N=9(2003)$.  Divide both sides by 3 to obtain $N=3(2003)=\\boxed{6009}$."
