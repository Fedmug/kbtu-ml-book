    "problem": "Giselle will combine blue paint, green paint, and white paint in the ratio $3:2:4$, respectively. If she uses $12$ quarts of white paint, how many quarts of green paint should she use?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The ratio of white paint to green paint is $4:2$ which simplifies to $2:1$, so Giselle should use twice as much white paint as green paint. Since she uses $12$ quarts of white paint, she should use $12 \\div 2 = \\boxed{6}$ quarts of green paint."
