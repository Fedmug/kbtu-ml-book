    "problem": "What number, when divided by 2, gives the same result as when 2 is subtracted from it?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If we let $x =$ the number that we want to find, we know that $x/2$ must equal $x-2$. Multiplying both sides of the equation $x/2=x-2$ by $2$, we have that $x=2x-4$, so $x=\\boxed{4}$."
