    "problem": "What is the measure, in degrees, of the acute angle formed by the hour hand and the minute hand of a 12-hour clock at 6:48?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "At 6:48, the minute hand is $\\frac{12}{60}(360^\\circ)=72$ degrees from the 12:00 position.  The hour hand is $\\frac{5\\frac{12}{60}}{12}(360^\\circ)=156$ degrees from the 12:00 position.  The difference in the two positions is $156^\\circ-72^\\circ=\\boxed{84}$ degrees."
