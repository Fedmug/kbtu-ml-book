    "problem": "What is the arithmetic mean of the integers from -4 through 5, inclusive? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 10 integers between $-4$ and 5 inclusive; the sum of these integers is 5, since the sum of the integers between $-4$ and 4 is zero. So the mean is $5/10 = \\boxed{0.5}$."
