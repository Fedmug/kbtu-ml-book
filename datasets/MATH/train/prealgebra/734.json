    "problem": "Eugene, Brianna, and Katie are going on a run. Eugene runs at a rate of 4 miles per hour. If Brianna runs $\\frac{2}{3}$ as fast as Eugene, and Katie runs $\\frac{7}{5}$ as fast as Brianna, how fast does Katie run?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since Brianna runs $\\frac{2}{3}$ as fast as Eugene and he runs at a rate of 4 miles per hour, then Brianna runs at a rate of  $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 4 = \\frac{(2)(4)}{3} = \\frac{8}{3}$ miles per hour. Since Katie runs $\\frac{7}{5}$ as fast as Brianna, Katie runs at a rate of $\\frac{7}{5} \\cdot \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{(7)(8)}{(5)(3)} = \\boxed{\\frac{56}{15}}$ miles per hour."
