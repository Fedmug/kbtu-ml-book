    "problem": "What is the largest whole number value of $n$ that makes the following inequality true? $$\\frac13 + \\frac{n}7 < 1$$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying both sides of the inequality by $7$, we have $$2\\frac13 + n < 7.$$Subtracting $\\frac73$ from both sides gives $$n < 4\\frac23.$$The largest integer satisfying this inequality is $n=\\boxed{4}$."
