    "problem": "The diagonal of a square is $\\sqrt{2}$ inches long. How many inches long is the side of the square?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since a diagonal of a square breaks up the square into two 45-45-90 triangles, a diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times longer than a side. Thus, the length of a side of the square is $\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=\\boxed{1}$ inch."
