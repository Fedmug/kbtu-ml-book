    "problem": "Solve for $r$: \\[\\frac{r-45}{2} = \\frac{3-2r}{5}.\\]",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying both sides by 2 and by 5 to eliminate the fractions gives \\[5(r-45) = 2(3-2r).\\] Expanding both sides gives $5r - 225 = 6-4r$.  Adding $4r$ and 225 to both sides gives $9r = 231$, so $r = \\frac{231}{9} = \\boxed{\\frac{77}{3}}$."
