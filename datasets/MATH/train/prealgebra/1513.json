    "problem": "The average of the five numbers in a list is 54. The average of the first two numbers is 48. What is the average of the last three numbers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of all five numbers is $5\\times 54=270$. The sum of the first two numbers is $2\\times 48=96$, so the sum of the last three numbers is $270-96=174$. The average of the last three numbers is $\\frac{174}{3}=\\boxed{58}$."
