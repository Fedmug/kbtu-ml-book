    "problem": "Paint is to be mixed so that the ratio of red paint to white paint is 3 to 2. If Ben wants to make 30 cans of the mixture and all cans hold the same volume of paint, how many cans of red paint will he need?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $3/(3+2)=3/5$ of the total amount of paint is red, he will need $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot30=\\boxed{18}$ cans of red paint."
