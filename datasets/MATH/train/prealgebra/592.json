    "problem": "An assortment of 200 pencils is sold through a catalog for $\\$19.90$. Shipping is an additional $\\$6.95$. Including the charges for both the pencils and the shipping, what is the average cost, in cents, for each pencil? Express your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.",

    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The average cost per pencil is equal to the total cost divided by the number of pencils. The total cost is $19.90+6.95=26.85$ dollars, or 2685 cents, and there are 200 pencils. Thus, the average cost is $\\frac{2685}{200}\\approx\\boxed{13}$ cents."
