    "problem": "Suppose I have 6 shirts, 4 ties, and 3 pairs of pants.  If an outfit requires a shirt and pants, and can either have a tie or not have a tie, how many outfits can I make?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 6 choices of shirt, 3 choices of pants, and 5 choices for either wearing one of the 4 ties or not wearing a tie at all, so the total number of outfits is $6 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{90}$."
