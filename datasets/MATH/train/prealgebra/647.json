    "problem": "If $\\frac{4}{3} (r + s + t) = 12$, what is the average of $r$, $s$, and $t$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The average of $r$, $s$, and $t$, is $\\frac{r+s+t}{3}$. Dividing both sides of the given equation by 4, we get $\\frac{r+s+t}{3}=\\boxed{3}.$"
