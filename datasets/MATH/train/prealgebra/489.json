    "problem": "At 11:00 a.m. how many degrees are in the smaller angle formed by the minute hand and the hour hand of the clock?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The minute hand is pointing directly at the 12 and the hour hand is pointing directly at the 11.  Therefore, the angle they form is $\\frac{1}{12}$ of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{1}{12}\\times 360^\\circ=\\boxed{30}$ degrees."
