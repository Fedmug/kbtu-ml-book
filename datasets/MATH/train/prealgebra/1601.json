    "problem": "If $3x-5=10x+9$, what is $4(x+7)$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Subtracting $3x+9$ from both sides of the first equation gives $-14=7x$. Dividing both sides of this equation by 7 shows that $x=-2$. Substituting this value of $x$ into $4(x+7)$ gives $4(-2+7)=4(5)=\\boxed{20}$."
