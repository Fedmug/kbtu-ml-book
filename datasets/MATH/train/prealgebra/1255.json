    "problem": "The diagonal lengths of a rhombus are 24 units and 10 units. What is the area of the rhombus, in square units?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of a rhombus can be expressed as: $\\frac{d_1 d_2}{2}$, where $d_1 , d_2$ are the lengths of the diagonals.  (Think of each quadrant as a triangle, and sum those areas - you'll see it comes out to this formula)  Plugging in $d_1 = 24$ and $d_2 = 10$, we get $\\frac{24\\cdot 10}{2} = \\boxed{120}$ square units."
