    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, we find a common denominator, which in this case is the least common multiple of $2$ and $3$, or $6$.  Thus we have $$\\frac{2(x+1)}{6}+\\frac{3(2-3x)}{6}=\\frac{2(x+1)+3(2-3x)}{6}.$$Simplifying the numerator, we get $$\\frac{2x+2+6-9x}{6}= \\boxed{\\frac{8-7x}{6}}.$$"
