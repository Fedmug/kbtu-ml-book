    "problem": "The complement of an angle is $5^{\\circ}$ more than four times the angle. What is the number of degrees in the measure of the angle?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the measure of the angle be $x$, so $5^\\circ$ more than four times the angle is $4x + 5^\\circ$.  Since these two measures are complementary, we have $x + (4x+5^\\circ) = 90^\\circ$.  Simplifying the left side gives $5x+5^\\circ = 90^\\circ$, so $5x = 85^\\circ$ and $x = \\boxed{17^\\circ}$."
