    "problem": "Find the product of all integer divisors of $105$ that also divide $14$.  (Recall that the divisors of an integer may be positive or negative.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The factors of $105$ are $\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\pm 5, \\pm 7, \\pm 15, \\pm 21, \\pm 35, \\pm 105$.  Of these, only $\\pm 1$ and $\\pm 7$ divide $14$.  Their product is $-7\\cdot -1\\cdot 1\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{49}$."
