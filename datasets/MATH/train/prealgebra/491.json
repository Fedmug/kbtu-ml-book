    "problem": "Choose the largest of the following sums, and express it as a fraction in simplest form:\n$$\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5}, \\ \\ \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6}, \\ \\ \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{3}, \\ \\ \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8}, \\ \\ \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{7}$$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We first recognize that $\\frac{1}{4}$ is a common fraction in each of the five sums, and so the relative size of the sums depends only on the other fractions. Since $\\frac{1}{3}$ is the largest of the fractions $$\\frac{1}{5}, \\ \\frac{1}{6}, \\ \\frac{1}{3}, \\ \\frac{1}{8}, \\ \\text{and} \\ \\frac{1}{7},$$ we conclude that $\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3}$ is the largest sum. We can simplify this sum by using a common denominator of $12:$ $$\n\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{3\\cdot1}{3\\cdot4}+\\frac{4\\cdot1}{4\\cdot 3}\n= \\frac{3+4}{12}\n= \\frac{7}{12}.\n$$ The answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$."
