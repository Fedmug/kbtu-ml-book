    "problem": "Find the largest integral value of $x$ which solves: $\\frac{1}{3}<{\\frac{x}{5}}<{\\frac{5}{8}}$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying by $5$, we have $\\frac53<x<\\frac{25}8$. Writing this with mixed numbers, we have $1\\frac23 < x < 3\\frac18$, so the possible integer values for $x$ are $2$ and $3$. Of these, the larger value is $\\boxed{3}$.\n\n(Note that only the second inequality matters here. We deal with the first inequality merely to show that there actually are integers satisfying both inequalities!)"
