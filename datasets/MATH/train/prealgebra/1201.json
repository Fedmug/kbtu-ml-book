    "problem": "A merchant offers a large group of items at $30\\%$ off.  Later, the merchant takes $20\\%$ off these sale prices and claims that the final price of these items is $50\\%$ off the original price.  As a percentage of the original price, what is the difference between the true discount and the merchant's claimed discount? (Your answer should be a positive difference.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The first discount means that the customer will pay $70\\%$ of the original price.  The second discount means a selling price of $80\\%$ of  the discounted price.  Because $0.80(0.70) = 0.56 = 56\\% $, the customer pays $56\\%$ of the original price and thus receives a $44\\%$ discount, for a difference of $50\\% - 44\\% = \\boxed{6\\%}$."
