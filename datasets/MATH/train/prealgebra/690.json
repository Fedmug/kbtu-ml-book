    "problem": "When the length of a rectangle is increased by $20\\%$ and the width increased by $10\\%$, by what percent is the area increased?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If we let the length of the rectangle be $l$ and the width be $w$, then the original area of the rectangle is $lw$. The length is then increased $20\\%$ to $1.2l$ and the width is increased $10\\%$ to $1.1w$, so the new area is $(1.2l)(1.1w)=1.32lw$. There new area is $132\\%$ the old area, which represents a change of $\\boxed{32 \\%}$."
