    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To start, we need to find a common denominator and add the fractions under the square root.  Be careful to do this first, and not mix up this kind of expression with: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}}+\\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}}$$ The two fractions have a common denominator of 100.  Combine them and simplify: $$\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{25}+\\frac{9}{4}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{64+225}{100}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{289}}{10}=\\boxed{\\frac{17}{10}}$$"
