    "problem": "There are 4 representatives from each of 4 companies at a convention. At the start of the convention, every person shakes hands once with every person except the other representatives from their company. How many handshakes are there?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "All 16 people shake hands with 12 other people (everyone except themselves and the other representatives from their company).  In multiplying $16 \\times 12$, each handshake is counted twice, so we divide by two to get the answer of $\\dfrac{16 \\times 12}{2} = \\boxed{96}$ handshakes."
