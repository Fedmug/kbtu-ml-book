    "problem": "What is the number of square meters in the area of a circle with diameter 4 meters? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A circle's radius is half its diameter, so if the diameter of a circle is 4 meters, then its radius is 2 meters.  The area of the circle is $\\pi(\\text{radius})^2=\\pi(2\\text{ m})^2=\\boxed{4\\pi}$ square meters."
