    "problem": "Apartment rentals in Fairview run $\\$$0.90 per square foot. Jillian has determined that she can afford $\\$$630 per month for rent. What is the largest apartment, in square feet, she should consider at the given rate?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the size of the apartment be $s$.  The cost will be $0.9s$.  The maximum comes when this is $630$, so\n\n$$630=0.9s\\Rightarrow s=\\boxed{700}$$\n\nsquare feet."
