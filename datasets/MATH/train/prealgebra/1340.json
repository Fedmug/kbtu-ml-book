    "problem": "A square has area $\\frac14$.  What is the side length of the square?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If $n$ is the side length of the square, we have $n=\\sqrt{\\frac14}$, so $n^2=\\frac14$. Since $\\left({\\frac12}\\right)^2=\\frac14$, we have $n = \\boxed{\\frac12}$."
