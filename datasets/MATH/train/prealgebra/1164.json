    "problem": "A tank is to be filled with water. When the tank is one-sixth full, 130 gallons of water are added, making the tank three-fifths full. How many gallons does the tank contain when it is completely full?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The difference between three-fifths full and one-sixth full is $\\frac{3}{5}-\\frac{1}{6}=\\frac{13}{30}$ of the tank's capacity.  Let $x$ be the capacity of the tank in gallons.  Since $\\frac{13}{30}$ of the tank's capacity is 130 gallons, we have $\\frac{13}{30}x = 130$.  Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{30}{13}$ gives $x = 300$, so the capacity is $\\boxed{300}$ gallons."
