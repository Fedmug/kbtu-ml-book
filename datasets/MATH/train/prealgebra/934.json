    "problem": "While standing in line to buy concert tickets, Kit moved 60 feet closer to the ticket window over a period of 30 minutes. At this rate, how many minutes will it take her to move the remaining 70 yards to the ticket window?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "She moved 60 feet in 30 minutes, meaning her rate is $\\frac{60}{30} = 2$ feet per minute.  She has $70\\cdot 3 = 210$ feet remaining, meaning she will need $\\frac{210}{2} = \\boxed{105}$ more minutes."
