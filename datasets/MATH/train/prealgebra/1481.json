    "problem": "Seven identical bowling balls weigh the same as three identical canoes. If one of the canoes weighs a total of 28 pounds, how many pounds does one of the bowling balls weigh?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If one canoe weighs 28 pounds, then three canoes weigh $3\\times 28$ pounds, and thus seven bowling balls weigh $3\\times 28$ pounds, and thus one bowling ball weighs $\\dfrac{3\\times 28}{7} = 3\\times 4 = \\boxed{12}$ pounds."
