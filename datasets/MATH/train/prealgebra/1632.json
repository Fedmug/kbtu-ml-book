    "problem": "To be eligible for an algebra class a student must have an average of at least $83\\%$ over all four quarters in his or her pre-algebra class. If Fisher had an $82\\%$, $77\\%$, and $75\\%$ in the first three quarters, what is the minimum score he must earn in the 4th quarter to move on to algebra?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To average $83\\%$ over four quarters, a student must earn a total of $4 \\times 83 = 332$ percentage points. So far Fisher has $82 + 77 + 75 = 234$ percentage points. He needs another $332 - 234 = 98$ percentage points, so he must earn a $\\boxed{98\\%}$ in the 4th quarter."
