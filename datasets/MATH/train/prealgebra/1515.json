    "problem": "Points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ lie on a line, in that order. If $AB=2$ units, $BC=5$ units and $AD=14$ units, what is the ratio of $AC$ to $BD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$AC = AB + BC = 7$. $BD = AD - AB = 12$. Thus, $AC:BD=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{12}}$."
