    "solution": "Only the $8$ corners of the cube have three faces painted red. Each edge has one cube that has $2$ faces painted red. There are $12$ edges, so $12$ cubes have $2$ faces painted red. Each of the six faces has only the center cube painted on exactly $1$ face, and the single cube in the center of the three-inch cube is the only one with no faces painted. We can thus produce the following table: $$\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\textbf{Number of red faces} & \\textbf{Number of one-inch cubes} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\ast3 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\ast2 & 12 \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 6 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{2}{|r|}{\n\\text{Total = 27}}\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$$\\ast$ Number of cubes with $2$ or $3$ red faces is $8 + 12 = \\boxed{20}.$"
