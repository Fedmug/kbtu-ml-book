    "problem": "Caroline can make eleven lassis out of two mangoes. How many lassis can she make out of twelve mangoes?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have $\\text{lassis}:\\text{mangoes} = 11:2$.  Multiplying both parts of the ratio by 6 gives \\[\\text{lassis}:\\text{mangoes} = 11:2 = 66:12,\\]so she can make $\\boxed{66}$ lassis."
