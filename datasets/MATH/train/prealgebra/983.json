    "problem": "How many numbers are in the list $ -33, -28, -23, \\ldots, 52, 57?$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Add 3 to each member of the list to get $-30,-25,-20,\\ldots,55,60$, and divide by 5 to get $-6$,$-5$,$-4$,$\\ldots$, $11$,$12$. Adding 7 to each number in the list gives $1,2,3,\\ldots,18,19$, so there are $\\boxed{19}$ numbers in the list."
