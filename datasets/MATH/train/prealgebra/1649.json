    "solution": "The sum of the areas of the squares is $PR^2+PQ^2+QR^2$.  By the Pythagorean theorem, $PR^2=PQ^2+QR^2$.  Substituting the left-hand side of this equation for the right-hand side, we find that the sum of the areas of the squares is $PR^2+PR^2=2\\cdot PR^2$.  Setting this equal to 338 square centimeters, we find that $PR^2=338/2=\\boxed{169}$ square centimeters."
