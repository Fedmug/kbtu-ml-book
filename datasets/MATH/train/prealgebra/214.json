    "problem": "Set $B = \\{55, 57, 58, 59, 61\\}.$  Which number in set B has the smallest prime factor?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The smallest prime is 2, which is a factor of every even number.  Because $\\boxed{58}$ is the only even number, it has the smallest prime factor."
