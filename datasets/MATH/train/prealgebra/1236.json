    "problem": "Simplify $((5p+1)-2p\\cdot4)(3)+(4-1\\div3)(6p-9)$ to a much simpler expression of the form $ap-b$ , where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We need to simplify the given expression. Let's start by simplifying the inside of the parenthesis on the left part of the expression. \\begin{align*}\n((5p+1)&-2p\\cdot4)(3)+(4-1\\div3)(6p-9)\\\\\n&=(5p+1-8p)(3)+(4-1\\div3)(6p-9)\\\\\n&=(-3p+1)(3)+(4-1\\div3)(6p-9)\n\\end{align*} Next we can distribute the 3 to get $$3\\cdot(-3p)+3\\cdot1+(4-1\\div3)(6p-9),$$ which equals $-9p+3+(4-1\\div3)(6p-9)$ . The left part looks simplified so now we can focus on the right part. Let's subtract what's in the left parentheses then distribute. \\begin{align*}\n-9p+3+(4-1\\div3)(6p-9)&=-9p+3+(\\frac{4\\cdot3}{3}-\\frac{1}{3})(6p-9)\\\\\n&=-9p+3+\\frac{11}{3}(6p-9)\\\\\n&=-9p+3+\\frac{11}{3}\\cdot6p-\\frac{11}{3}\\cdot9\\\\\n&=-9p+3+\\frac{11\\cdot6p}{3}-\\frac{11\\cdot9}{3}\\\\\n&=-9p+3+\\frac{66p}{3}-\\frac{99}{3}\\\\\n&=-9p+3+\\frac{3\\cdot22p}{3}-\\frac{3\\cdot33}{3}\\\\\n&=-9p+3+22p-33\\\\\n&=22p-9p+3-33\\\\\n&=\\boxed{13p-30}\\\\\n\\end{align*}"
