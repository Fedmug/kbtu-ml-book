    "problem": "Jasmine wishes to purchase some trading cards. She has $\\$7.50$ and the cards each cost $\\$0.85$, tax included. What is the most number of cards she can buy?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The cost of $n$ cards is $(0.85)n$ dollars. Jasmine can buy $n$ cards only if $(0.85)n \\le 7.5$. Rewriting this inequality in terms of fractions, we have $$\\frac{17}{20}n\\le \\frac{15}{2}.$$ Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{20}{17}$ gives $$n \\le \\frac{150}{17},$$ and converting to mixed numbers gives $$n \\le 8\\frac{14}{17}.$$ Since Jasmine must buy a whole number of trading cards, the largest number she can afford is $\\boxed{8}$."
