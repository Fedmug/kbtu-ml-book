    "problem": "Javier is going to Disneyland during spring break. He plans on visiting four particular attractions all before lunch. In how many orders could he visit all four attractions once?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 4 ways to choose which to visit first, then 3 ways to choose which to visit next, then 2 ways to choose where to go after that, and then 1 way to choose where to go last.  This gives a total of $4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{24}$ possible orders."
