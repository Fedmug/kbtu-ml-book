    "problem": "The mean of one set of five numbers is 13, and the mean of a separate set of six numbers is 24. What is the mean of the set of all eleven numbers?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the numbers from the first set is $5\\cdot 13=65$.  The sum of the numbers from the second set is $24\\cdot 6 = 144$.  The sum of all the numbers in the set is $144+65=209$, so the average of the 11 numbers in the set is $209/11=\\boxed{19}$."
