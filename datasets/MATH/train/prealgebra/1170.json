    "problem": "The mean (average) of 6, 9 and 18 is equal to the mean (average) of 12 and $y$. What is the value of $y$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The mean of 6, 9 and 18 is $$\\frac{6+9+18}{3}=\\frac{33}{3}=11.$$Since the mean of 12 and $y$ is thus 11, then the sum of 12 and $y$ is $2(11)=22$, so $y=\\boxed{10}$."
