    "problem": "A regular polygon has interior angles of 120 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of sides in the polygon.  The sum of the interior angles in any $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$ degrees.  Since each angle in the given polygon measures $120^\\circ$, the sum of the interior angles of this polygon is also $120n$.  Therefore, we must have  \\[180(n-2) = 120n.\\] Expanding the left side gives $180n - 360 = 120n$, so $60n = 360$ and $n = \\boxed{6}$.\n\nWe might also have noted that each exterior angle of the given polygon measures $180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^\\circ$.  The exterior angles of a polygon sum to $360^\\circ$, so there must be $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60^\\circ} = 6$ of them in the polygon."
