    "solution": "If the area formed by 6 congruent squares is 294, the area formed by one of these squares is $294/6 = 49$. Thus, the side of each square is 7.\n\nThere are 8 horizontal sides and 6 vertical sides in the perimeter, for a total of 14 sides. Thus, the perimeter of this region is $14\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{98}$."
