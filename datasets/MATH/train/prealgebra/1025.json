    "problem": "The median of the set of numbers $\\{$12, 38, 45, $x$, 14$\\}$ is five less than the mean. If $x$ is a negative integer, what is the value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since $x$ is negative, the median of the set is 14.  Therefore, the mean of the set is $14+5=19$, and its sum is $19\\cdot 5=95$.  Since 12, 38, 45, and 14 sum to 109, the remaining integer $x$ must be $95-109=\\boxed{-14}$."
