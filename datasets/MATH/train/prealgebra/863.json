    "problem": "A triangle has side lengths of 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the area of the triangle, in square units?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We see that $8^2+15^2=64+225=289=17^2$.  So the triangle is a right triangle with legs $8$ and $15$, and thus its area is\n\n$$\\frac{8(15)}{2}=\\boxed{60}$$"
