    "problem": "The areas of three squares are 16, 49 and 169.  What is the average (mean) of their side lengths?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the areas of the three squares are 16, 49 and 169, then their side lengths are $\\sqrt{16}=4$, $\\sqrt{49}=7$ and $\\sqrt{169}=13$, respectively.\n\nThus, the average of their side lengths is $$\\frac{4+7+13}{3}=\\boxed{8}.$$"
