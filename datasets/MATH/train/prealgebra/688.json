    "problem": "The scores on a $110$-point test were organized in the stem-and-leaf plot shown. $9 | 6$ represents $96$ points. What is the mode of the scores? \\begin{tabular}{c|lllllll}\n\\multicolumn{8}{c}{\\underline{Points on the Test}}\\\\\n5 &0 & 0 & & & & &\\\\\n6 &3 & & & & & &\\\\\n7 &7 & 8 & & & & &\\\\\n8 &2 & 6 & 7 & 9 & 9 & 9 & 9\\\\\n9 &1 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 6 & &\\\\\n10 &0 & 0 & 0 & & & &\\\\\n\\end{tabular}",
    "level": "Level 3",
