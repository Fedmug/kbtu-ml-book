    "problem": "What is the measure, in degrees, of one interior angle of a regular hexagon?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We know that the sum of the interior angles of a $n$-gon is equal to $180(n-2)$ degrees, so the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon (six sides) is $180(6-2)=180 \\cdot 4$ degrees. Since a regular hexagon has six interior angles with equal degree measures, one of these angles would have a measure of $\\frac{180 \\cdot 4}{6}=30\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{120}$ degrees."
