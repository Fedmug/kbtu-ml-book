    "problem": "A pentagon is drawn by placing an isosceles right triangle on top of a square as pictured. What percent of the area of the pentagon is the area of the right triangle?\n\n[asy]\nsize(50);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,-1)--(1,-1)--(1,0)--(0,0)--(.5,.5)--(1,0));\n[/asy]",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the leg length of the isosceles right triangle be $x$, so the hypotenuse of the triangle has length $x\\sqrt{2}$.  The hypotenuse of the triangle is a side of the square, so the area of the square is $(x\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2x^2$.  The area of the triangle is $(x)(x)/2 = x^2/2$.  So, the area of the pentagon is  \\[\\frac{x^2}{2} + 2x^2 = \\frac{5x^2}{2}.\\]Therefore, the fraction of the pentagon's area that is inside the triangle is  \\[\\frac{x^2/2}{5x^2/2} =\\frac{x^2}{2}\\cdot \\frac{2}{5x^2} = \\frac15 = \\boxed{20\\%}.\\](As an alternate solution, consider drawing the two diagonals of the square. What do you find?)"
