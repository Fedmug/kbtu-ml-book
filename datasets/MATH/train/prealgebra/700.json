    "problem": "What is the degree measure of an interior angle of a regular pentagon?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Any convex pentagon may be subdivided into three triangles, each with a total angle sum of 180 degrees. Thus, the sum of the interior angles of any convex pentagon is $3 \\times 180 = 540$ degrees. If the pentagon is regular, then each of its five angles will have the same measure of $540 \\div 5 = \\boxed{108\\text{ degrees}}$."
