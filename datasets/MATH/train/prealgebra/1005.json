    "problem": "How many numbers are in the list $$ 1, 4, 7, \\ldots, 2005, 2008 ?$$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Adding 2 to each member of the list, we get $$3, 6, 9, \\ldots, 2007, 2010,$$ and then dividing each member of the list by 3, we get $$1,2,3,\\ldots,669,670,$$ so there are $\\boxed{670}$ numbers."
