    "problem": "Apples are sold at the farmer's market at a rate of $\\$4$ per five pounds. According to this rate, how many dollars does it cost to buy 15 pounds of apples?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have the ratio $5 \\text{ pounds}:\\$4$. Multiplying both sides of the ratio by 3 does not change the ratio. Doing so, we get $15 \\text{ pounds}:\\$12$. Thus, 15 pounds of apples costs $\\boxed{12}$ dollars."
