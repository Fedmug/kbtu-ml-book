    "problem": "The 5 a.m. temperatures for seven consecutive days were $-7^{\\circ}$, $-4^{\\circ}$, $-4^{\\circ}$, $-5^{\\circ}$, $1^{\\circ}$, $3^{\\circ}$ and $2^{\\circ}$ Celsius. What is the mean 5 a.m. temperature for the week in degrees Celsius?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To add these up quickly, a trick is to simply cancel out one of the $-4$ and the 1 and 3, because those will sum to 0, and then add up 2 and $-5$ to make $-3$.  Pairing that with $-7$ to make $-10$, and then $-14$.  Dividing by 7, we get an average of $\\boxed{-2}$."
