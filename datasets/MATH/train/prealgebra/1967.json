    "problem": "An edge of a square can be expressed as $4x-15$ meters or as $20-3x$ meters. What is its area in square meters?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Set $4x-15$ equal to $20-3x$ to find \\begin{align*}\n4x-15&=20-3x \\\\\n7x&=35 \\\\\nx&=5.\n\\end{align*} Substituting $x=5$ into either $4x-15$ or $20-3x$, we find that the side length of the square is 5 meters and its area is $(5\\text{ m})^2=\\boxed{25}$ square meters."
