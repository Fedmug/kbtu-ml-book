    "problem": "How many two-digit positive integers have at least one 7 as a digit?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 10 two-digit numbers with a 7 as their 10's digit, and 9 two-digit numbers with 7 as their units digit. Because 77 satisfies both of these properties, the answer is $10+9-1 = \\boxed{18}$."
