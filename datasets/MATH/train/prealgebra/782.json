    "problem": "Suppose we roll a standard fair 6-sided die.  What is the probability that a perfect square is rolled?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "A 1 or 4 can be rolled for success, which is 2 out of 6 possible outcomes, so its probability is $\\dfrac26 = \\boxed{\\dfrac13}$."
