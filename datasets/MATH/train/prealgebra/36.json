    "problem": "A car travels 192 miles on 6 gallons of gas. How far can it travel on 8 gallons of gas?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$\\frac{8}{6}=\\frac{4}{3}$ so 8 gallons is $4/3$ as much gas as 6 gallons is. Since the distance that a car can travel is directly proportional to the amount of gas that it has, if a car can travel $192$ miles on 6 gallons of gas, it can travel $192 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=64 \\cdot 4 = \\boxed{256}$ miles on 8 gallons of gas."
