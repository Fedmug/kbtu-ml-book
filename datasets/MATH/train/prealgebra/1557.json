    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, we add the two numbers. \\[ \\begin{array}{@{}c@{\\;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & 8 & 1. & 7 & 6 & \\\\ +& & 3 & 4. & 5 & 8 & 7\\\\ \\cline{1-7}& 1 & 1 & 6. & 3 & 4 & 7\\\\ \\end{array} \\]In order to round the result, $116.347$, to the nearest tenth, we must consider the hundredths place. The hundredths digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so the tenths place remains $3$. The answer after rounding is thus $\\boxed{116.3}$."
