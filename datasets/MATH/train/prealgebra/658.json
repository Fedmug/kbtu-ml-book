    "problem": "There are 6 married couples at a party. At the start of the party, every person shakes hands once with every other person except his or her spouse. How many handshakes are there?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "All 12 people shake hands with 10 other people (everyone except themselves and their spouse).  In multiplying $12 \\times 10$, each handshake is counted twice, so we divide by two to get the answer of $\\dfrac{12 \\times 10}{2} = \\boxed{60}$ handshakes."
