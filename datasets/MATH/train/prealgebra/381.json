    "problem": "What is the greatest common factor of 40 and 48?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$40=2^3\\cdot5$ and $48=2^4\\cdot3$. The prime factorization of their greatest common factor cannot contain any other primes besides 2 raised to no more than the 3rd power, otherwise it would not be a factor of both numbers. Thus, their GCF is $2^3=\\boxed{8}$."
