    "problem": "The average age of the three Wilson children is 7 years. If the two younger children are 4 years old and 7 years old, how many years old is the oldest child?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the age of the oldest child be $x$. We are told that $\\frac{4 + 7 + x}{3} = 7$. Multiplying by 3, we see that $11 + x = 21$. We conclude that $x = \\boxed{10}$."
