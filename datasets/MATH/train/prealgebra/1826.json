    "problem": "Find the greatest whole number that will satisfy this inequality: $4x-3 < 2 - x $.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We simplify the given inequality by adding $x+3$ to both sides, which leaves us with $5x < 5 \\Rightarrow x<1$. Since 1 is not less than itself, this leaves us with $x=\\boxed{0}$."
