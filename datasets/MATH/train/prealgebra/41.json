    "problem": "What is the degree measure of the supplement of the complement of a 42-degree angle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "By definition, the complement of an angle $\\alpha$ is $90^\\circ - \\alpha$, and the supplement of an angle $\\alpha$ is $180^\\circ - \\alpha$.\n\nThus, the complement of a 42-degree angle is $90 - 42 = 48$ degrees, and the supplement of a 48-degree angle is $180 - 48 = \\boxed{132}$ degrees."
