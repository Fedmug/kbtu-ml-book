    "problem": "What is $6 \\div 0.\\overline{6}$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First let's convert $0.\\overline{6}$ to a fraction. Let $p=0.\\overline{6}$ and multiply both sides of this equation by 10 to obtain $10p=6.\\overline{6}$. Subtracting the left-hand sides $10p$ and $p$ as well as the right-hand sides $6.\\overline{6}$ and $0.\\overline{6}$ of these two equations gives $9p=6$, which implies $p=2/3$. We divide $6$ by $2/3$ to get $$6 \\div \\frac{2}{3} = \\cancelto{3}{6}\\hspace{1mm} \\cdot \\frac{3}{\\cancel{2}} = \\boxed{9}.$$"
