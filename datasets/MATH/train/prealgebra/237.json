    "problem": "What is the remainder when the sum of the first five primes is divided by the sixth prime?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the first five primes is $2+3+5+7+11=28$. Divide the sum by the next prime, 13, to get $28\\div13=2R2$. Thus the remainder is $\\boxed{2}$."
