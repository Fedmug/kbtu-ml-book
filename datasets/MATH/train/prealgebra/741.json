    "problem": "In Chemistry class, Samantha finds that she can make a certain solution by mixing $.04$ liters of chemical A with $.02$ liters of water (this gives her $.06$ liters of the solution). She wants to make a total of $.48$ liters of this new solution.  To do so, how many liters of water will she use?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Firstly, we find that $\\frac{.02}{.06}=\\frac{1}{3}$ is the fraction of water in the solution.  Thus, since Samantha wants $.48$ total liters of the solution, we have that she must use $.48 \\times \\frac{1}{3}=\\boxed{0.16}$ liters of water."
