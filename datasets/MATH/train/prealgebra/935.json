    "problem": "Four fair coins are to be flipped. What is the probability that all four will be heads or all four will be tails? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Each coin has 2 possible outcomes, so the total number of possible outcomes is $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=2^4=16$. Two of these are all tails and all heads, so the probability is $\\frac{2}{16}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}$."
