    "problem": "What is the measure, in degrees, of the acute angle formed by the minute hand and the hour hand on a standard clock when it indicates $9$:$40$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The hour hand is $40/60=2/3$ of the way from the 9 to the 10 on the clock, which the minute hand is on the 8. Between any two numbers on the clock there are $360/12=30$ degrees. Thus, the angle between the two hands is $30+30(2/3)=\\boxed{50}$ degrees."
