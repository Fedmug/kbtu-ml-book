    "problem": "The hypotenuse of a right triangle measures $6\\sqrt{2}$ inches and one angle is $45^{\\circ}$. What is the number of square inches in the area of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If one acute angle of a right triangle is $45^\\circ$, then the other is $90^\\circ-45^\\circ =45^\\circ$, so the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle.  The hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, so each leg has 6.  Therefore, the area of the triangle is $(6)(6)/2 = \\boxed{18}$."
