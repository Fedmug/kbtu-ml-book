    "problem": "Marguerite drove 100 miles in 2.4 hours. If Sam drove for 3 hours at the same average rate as Marguerite, how many miles did he drive?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have that Marguerite drove $100 \\textnormal{ miles}$ in $2.4 \\textnormal{ hours}$. We are told that this proportionality applies to Sam as well. So, if Sam drove for $3 \\textnormal{ hours},$ he must have traveled $100 \\textnormal{ miles} \\cdot \\frac{3 \\textnormal{ hours}}{2.4 \\textnormal{ hours}}$, or $\\boxed{125\\textnormal{ miles}}.$"
