    "problem": "What is the probability, expressed as a decimal, of drawing one marble which is either red or blue from a bag containing 3 red, 2 blue, and 5 yellow marbles?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are ten total marbles, and five are either red or blue. Thus, the probability is $\\frac{5}{10} = \\frac{1}{2},$ or $\\boxed{0.5}.$"
