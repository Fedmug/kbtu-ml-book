    "problem": "In a class of $40$ students, $18$ said they liked apple pie, $15$ said they liked chocolate cake, and $12$ said they did not like either. How many students in the class liked both?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Of the $40$ students, $12$ did not like either dessert. Therefore, $40-12=28$ students liked at least one of the desserts. But $18$ students said they liked apple pie, $15$ said they liked chocolate cake, and $18+15=33,$ so $33-28=\\boxed{5}$ students must have liked both of the desserts."
