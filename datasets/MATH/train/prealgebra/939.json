    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Factoring all three numbers, we find that $10=2\\cdot 5$, $11=11$, and $12=2^2\\cdot 3$. Taking the highest power of each, we see that the least common multiple of the three numbers is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 11=60\\cdot 11=\\boxed{660}$."
