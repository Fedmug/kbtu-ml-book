    "problem": "A square has an area of $25.$ A rectangle has the same width as the square. The length of the rectangle is double its width. What is the area of the rectangle?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "For the square to have an area of $25,$ each side length must be $\\sqrt{25}=5.$\n\nThe rectangle's width is equal to that of the square and therefore must also be $5.$ The length of the rectangle is double its width or $5\\times 2=10.$ The area of the rectangle is thus $5\\times 10=\\boxed{50}.$"
