    "problem": "If $C=\\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$, what is $F$ when $C=20$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We have $20 = \\frac59(F-32)$.  Multiplying both sides by 9 to get rid of the fraction gives  \\[9\\cdot 20 = 9\\cdot \\frac59 (F-32),\\] so $180 = 5(F-32)$.  We could distribute on the right-hand side, but it's a bit faster to divide both sides by 5, giving $36 = F-32$.  Adding 32 to both sides gives $F = \\boxed{68}$."
