    "problem": "Allen and Ben are painting a fence. The ratio of the amount of work Allen does to the amount of work Ben does is $3:5$. If the fence requires a total of $240$ square feet to be painted, how many square feet does Ben paint?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Between them, Allen and Ben are dividing the work into $8$ equal parts, $3$ of which Allen does and $5$ of which Ben does. Each part of the work requires $\\frac{240}{8} = 30$ square feet to be painted. Since Ben does $5$ parts of the work, he will paint $30 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{150}$ square feet of the fence."
