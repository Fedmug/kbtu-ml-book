    "problem": "A convex pentagon has interior angles with measures $x+1$, $2x$, $3x$, $4x$, and $5x-1$ degrees.  What is the measure of the largest angle?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the interior angles of this pentagon is $(5-2)\\cdot180=540$ degrees. Thus, we have the equation $540=(x+1)+2x+3x+4x+(5x-1)\\Rightarrow 540 = 15x \\Rightarrow x=36$. The largest angle has measure $5x-1$, or $5\\cdot36-1=\\boxed{179}$ degrees."
