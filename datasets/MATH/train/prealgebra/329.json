    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "[asy]\nunitsize(0.8inch);\nfor (int i=0 ; i<=11 ;++i)\n{\ndraw((rotate(i*30)*(0.8,0)) -- (rotate(i*30)*(1,0)));\nlabel(format(\"%d\",i+1),(rotate(60 - i*30)*(0.68,0)));\n}\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1),linewidth(1.1));\ndraw((0,0.7)--(0,0)--(rotate(-120)*(0.5,0)),linewidth(1.2));\n[/asy]\n\nThere are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\\circ/12 = 30^\\circ$ from its neighbors.  At 7:00, the minute hand points at the 12, while the hour hand points at hour 7.  So, the hands are 5 \"hours\" apart, which means that the angle between the hands is $5\\cdot 30^\\circ = \\boxed{150^\\circ}$."
