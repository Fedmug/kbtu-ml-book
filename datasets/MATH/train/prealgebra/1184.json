    "problem": "If the area of a circle is less than $60\\pi$ square inches, what is the greatest possible integer value in inches of the radius of the circle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of a circle is defined as $\\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. Since $\\pi r^2 < 60\\pi$, $r^2<60$, and since $r$ must be an integer, the greatest possible $r$ is $\\boxed{7}$ inches."
