    "problem": "What is the mean value of the measures of the three interior angles of any triangle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of those numbers divided by the total number of numbers.  The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, and there are 3 angles.  Hence their mean is $\\frac{180^\\circ}{3} = \\boxed{60^\\circ}$."
