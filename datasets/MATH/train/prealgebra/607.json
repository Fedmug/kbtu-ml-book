    "problem": "Find one third of 5.4, expressed as a simplified fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, we take $5.4 \\div 3 = 1.8$.  Then, we convert 1.8 to a fraction.  Since $1.8 = \\frac{18}{10}$, we can simplify this fraction to yield $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{5}}$."
