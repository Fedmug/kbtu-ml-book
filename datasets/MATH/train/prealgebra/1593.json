    "problem": "Find: $\\frac{12}{30}-\\frac{1}{7}$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Because the first term of the expression, 12/30, is not simplified, we simplify before continuing, \\[\n\\frac{12}{30} = \\frac{6}{6}\\cdot\\frac{2}{5} = 1\\cdot\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}.\n\\]However, the two terms have different denominators, so we have to find a common denominator, \\[\n\\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot \\frac{7}{7} - \\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{5}{5} = \\frac{14}{35} - \\frac{5}{35} = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{35}}.\n\\]The answer is in simplest form."
