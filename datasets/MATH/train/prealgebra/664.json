    "problem": "The diagonals of a rhombus are $10$ inches and $24$ inches. What is the perimeter of the rhombus, in inches?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, so therefore the side length of the rhombus can be calculated as $\\sqrt{5^2+12^2} = 13$. Therefore, the perimeter of the rhombus is $4 \\times 13 = \\boxed{52}$ inches."
