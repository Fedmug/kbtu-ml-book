    "problem": "The mean of $5,8$ and $17$ is equal to the mean of $12$ and $y$. What is the value of $y$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "To find the mean, we add up the terms and divide by the number of terms. The mean of $5, 8$ and $17$ is $\\frac{5+8+17}{3}=\\frac{30}{3}=10$. We set this equal to the mean of $12$ and $y$ and get $$10=\\frac{12+y}{2}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 20=12+y\\qquad\\Rightarrow 8=y.$$ The value of $y$ is $\\boxed{8}$."
