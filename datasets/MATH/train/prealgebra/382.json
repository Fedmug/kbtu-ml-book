    "problem": "How many multiples of 10 are between 9 and 101?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The first multiple of $10$ greater than $9$ is $10$, and the last multiple of $10$ less than $101$ is $100$. The list of multiples of $10$ proceeds: $10$, $20$, $\\ldots$, $100$. Divide each number by $10$, and the list becomes $1$, $2$, $\\ldots$, $10$. It is easy to see that the number of numbers in this list is $\\boxed{10}$."
