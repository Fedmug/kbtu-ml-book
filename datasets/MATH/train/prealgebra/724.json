    "problem": "For a designer suit, Daniel must specify his waist size in centimeters. If there are $12$ inches in a foot and $30.5$ centimeters in a foot, then what size should Daniel specify, in centimeters, if his waist size in inches is $34$ inches?  (You may use a calculator on this problem; answer to the nearest tenth.)",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We use the conversion factors $\\frac{1\\ \\text{ft}}{12\\ \\text{in.}}$ and $\\frac{30.5\\ \\text{cm}}{1\\ \\text{ft}}$ to find that Daniel's waist size in centimeters is $34\\ \\text{in.} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{ft}}{12\\ \\text{in.}} \\cdot \\frac{30.5\\ \\text{cm}}{1\\ \\text{ft}} \\approx \\boxed{86.4}$ centimeters."
