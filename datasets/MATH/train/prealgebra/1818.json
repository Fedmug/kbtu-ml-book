    "problem": "What fraction of $\\frac{1}{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{7}$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "This problem is asking for $\\frac{\\frac{1}{7}}{\\frac{1}{2}}$.  (More advanced students can analyze this alternatively by rewriting this worded statement as an equation, we have $x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{7}$, where $x$ is the fraction of $\\frac{1}{2}$ that we are solving for.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{1}{2}$, we have $x = \\frac{\\frac{1}{7}}{\\frac{1}{2}}$).  We can simplify this fraction as $\\frac{1}{7} \\cdot \\frac{2}{1}$, since division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal.  Multiplying these two fractions then yields $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}$."
