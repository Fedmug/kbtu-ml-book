    "problem": "What is the largest positive multiple of $12$ that is less than $350?$",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Dividing $350$ by $12$ gives a quotient $29$ with a remainder of $2$. In other words, \\[350=12\\cdot29+2.\\]Thus, $29\\cdot12=\\boxed{348}$ is the largest multiple of $12$ which is less than $350.$"
