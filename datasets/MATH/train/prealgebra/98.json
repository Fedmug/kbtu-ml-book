    "problem": "How many numbers in the set $\\{3,13,23,33, \\ldots\\}$ can be written as the difference of two primes?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Notice that when we subtract two integers, the difference can only be odd if one integer is even and one integer is odd (even - even = even and odd - odd = even). If one integer is even, then that integer is divisible by 2 and thus not prime. The only exception is 2, the only even prime number. So one of the primes must be 2. If we add 2 to each number in the set to find the other prime, we end up with $\\{5, 15, 25, 35, \\ldots\\}$. All of the numbers in the set are divisible by 5, which means the only prime number in the set is 5. So the only number in the set  $\\{3,13,23,33, \\ldots\\}$ that can be written as the difference of two primes is $5-2=3$. The answer is $\\boxed{1}$ number."
