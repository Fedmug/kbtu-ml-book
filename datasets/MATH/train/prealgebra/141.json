    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying both sides by 2 and by 7 to eliminate fractions gives  \\[7(c-23) = 2(2c+5).\\] Expanding both sides gives $7c - 161 = 4c + 10$.  Subtracting $4c$ from both sides gives $3c -161= 10$, and adding 161 to both sides gives $3c = 171$.  Finally, dividing by 3 gives $c = \\frac{171}{3} = \\boxed{57}$."
