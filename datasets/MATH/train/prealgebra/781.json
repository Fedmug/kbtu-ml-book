    "problem": "The ratio of the measures of the acute angles of a right triangle is $8:1$. In degrees, what is the measure of the largest angle of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The actual degree measures of the acute angles don't matter. A right triangle consists of a right angle of $90^\\circ$ and two acute angles that add up to $90^\\circ$, so each of the two acute angles is smaller than the right angle. Also recall that the definition of an acute angle is that its degree measure is less than $90^\\circ$. So the largest angle of the triangle is the right angle, which has a measure of $\\boxed{90^\\circ}$."
