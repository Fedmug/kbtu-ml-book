    "problem": "A circle has an area of $\\pi$ square units. What is the length of the circle's diameter, in units?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Call the length of the radius $r$ units. $r^2\\pi=\\pi$, so $r=1$. The diameter is twice the radius, or $\\boxed{2}$ units."
