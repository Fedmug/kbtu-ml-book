    "problem": "How many different 7-digit positive integers exist? (Note that we don't allow \"7-digit\" integers that start with 0, such as 0123456; this is actually a 6-digit integer.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are 9 choices for the first digit (it can be 1-9) and 10 choices for each of the other 6 digits (they can be 0-9). So there are $9 \\cdot 10^6 = \\boxed{9,\\!000,\\!000}$ possible numbers."
