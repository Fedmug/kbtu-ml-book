    "problem": "Malcolm can run a race at a speed of 6 minutes per mile, while Joshua runs at 8 minutes per mile. In a 10-mile race, how many minutes after Malcolm crosses the finish line will Joshua cross the finish line if they start the race together?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Malcolm will take $6 \\cdot 10 = 60$ minutes to finish the race, and Joshua will take $8 \\cdot 10 = 80$ minutes to finish the race. Thus, Joshua will cross the finish line $80 - 60 = \\boxed{20}$ minutes after Malcolm."
