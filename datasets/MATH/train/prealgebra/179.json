    "problem": "Find the least common multiple of 8 and 15.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "$8 = 2^3$, $15 = 3^1 \\cdot 5^1$, so lcm$[8, 15] = 2^3 \\cdot 3^1 \\cdot 5^1 = \\boxed{120}$.\n\nNotice that, since 8 and 15 have no common factors (greater than 1), their least common multiple is equal to their product."
