    "problem": "To make pizza dough, Luca mixes 50 mL of milk for every 250 mL of flour. How many mL of milk does he mix with 750 mL of flour?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We divide the 750 mL of flour into portions of 250 mL.  We do this by calculating $750 \\div 250 = 3$. Therefore, 750 mL is three portions of 250 mL.\n\nSince 50 mL of milk is required for each 250 mL of flour, then $3\\times 50 = \\boxed{150}$ mL of milk is required in total."
