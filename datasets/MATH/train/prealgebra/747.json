If point $M$ is the midpoint of arc $AB$, what is the length of segment $MC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.

    "solution": "If we let $E$ be the midpoint of line segment $AB$ and $F$ be the midpoint of $CD$, then line segment $MF$ will pass through point $E$. Also, $MF$ is perpendicular to $CD$, so $\\triangle MFC$ is a right triangle. Now, if we can find the lengths of $MF$ and $FC$, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $MC$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(4cm);\n\ndotfactor = 4;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(1)+fontsize(10pt));\n\npair A,B,C,D,E,F,M;\nA = (0,1);\nB = (1,1);\nC = (1,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = (.5,1);\nF = (.5,0);\nM = (.5,1.5);\n\ndraw(A..M..B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(M--E--F);\n\ndot(\"A\",A,W);\ndot(\"M\",M,N);\ndot(\"B\",B,E);\ndot(\"C\",C,E);\ndot(\"D\",D,W);\ndot(\"E\",E,NW);\ndot(\"F\",F,NW);\n\ndraw(M--C,linetype(\"0 4\"));\ndraw((.5,.1)--(.6,.1)--(.6,0));\n[/asy]\n\nSince $F$ is the midpoint of $CD$ and $CD$ has length $6$, $FC$ has length $3$. $EF$ has length $6$, because it has the same length as the side length of the square. $ME$ is the radius of the semicircle. Since the diameter of the semicircle is $6$ (the same as the side length of the square), $ME$ has length $3$. Now, $MF = ME + EF = 3 + 6 = 9$. Finally, from the Pythagorean Theorem, we have that $MC^2 = MF^2 + FC^2 = 9^2 + 3^2 = 90$, so $MC = \\sqrt{90} = \\boxed{3\\sqrt{10}}$ cm."
