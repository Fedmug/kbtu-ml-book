    "problem": "The average age of the 40 members of a computer science camp is 17 years. There are 20 girls, 15 boys, and 5 adults. If the average age of the girls is 15 and the average age of the boys is 16, what is the average age of the adults?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of all ages is $40\\times 17=680$. The sum of the girls' ages is $20\\times 15=300$ and the sum of the boys' ages is $15\\times 16=240$. The sum of the five adults' ages is $680-300-240=140$. Therefore, their average is $\\frac{140}{5}=\\boxed{28}$."
