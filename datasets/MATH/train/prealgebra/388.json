    "problem": "The four partners in a business decide to split the profits of their company in the ratio 2:3:3:5. If the profit one year is $\\$26,\\!000$ what is the largest number of dollars received by any of the four partners?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "You can think of the money being split into $2+3+3+5$ parts, and each partner getting his corresponding number of parts as his share.  That makes for a total of 13 parts, meaning that each part consists of $\\$2,\\!000,$ and the largest share received is $5\\cdot 2,\\!000 = \\boxed{10,\\!000}$."
