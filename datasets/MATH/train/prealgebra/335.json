    "problem": "What is the largest prime factor of 999?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "First, divide out 9 to obtain $999=9\\cdot111$.  Since $1+1+1=3$, 111 is divisible by 3.  Dividing, we find $111=3\\cdot 37$.  Therefore, $999=3^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 37=3^3\\cdot 37$ and the largest prime factor of 999 is $\\boxed{37}$."
