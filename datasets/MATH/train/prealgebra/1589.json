    "problem": "At the end of the day, a bakery had $\\frac{6}{7}$ of a pie left over. Louie, Duey and Huey split the pie, with each taking home the same amount of leftover pie. How much pie did Louie take home?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since there are $3$ people who took home pieces of $\\frac{6}{7}$ of a pie, we must divide $\\frac{6}{7}$ by $3$. \\[\n\\frac{6}{7} \\div 3 = \\frac{6}{7} \\div \\frac{3}{1} = \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 1}{7 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{6}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{2}{7}.\n\\] Therefore Louie, Duey, and Huey each took home $\\frac{2}{7}$ of a pie, and as such, Louie took home $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}\\text{ of a pie}$."
