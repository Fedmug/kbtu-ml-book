    "problem": "A jar contains $29\\frac{5}{7}$ tablespoons of peanut butter. If one serving of peanut butter is 2 tablespoons, how many servings of peanut butter does the jar contain? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The jar contains $29\\frac{5}{7}\\div 2$ servings of peanut butter. Recalling that $a\\div b=\\frac{a}{b}$, we get $$29\\frac{5}{7}\\div 2=29\\frac{5}{7}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{208}{7}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{104}{7}=14\\frac{6}{7}.$$The jar contains $\\boxed{14\\frac{6}{7}}$ servings of peanut butter."
