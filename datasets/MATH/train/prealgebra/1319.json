    "problem": "What is the product of the numerator and the denominator when $0.\\overline{009}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let $x=0.\\overline{009}$. Then $1000x=9.\\overline{009}$ and $1000x-x=999x=9$. Therefore, $0.\\overline{009}=\\frac{9}{999}$, which in lowest terms is $\\frac{1}{111}$. The product of the numerator and the denominator is $1\\cdot 111=\\boxed{111}$."
