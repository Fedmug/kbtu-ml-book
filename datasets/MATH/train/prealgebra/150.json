    "problem": "The product of three consecutive integers is 210. What is their sum?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "We find the prime factorization of 210 to be $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7$. Noticing that $2 \\cdot 3=6$, we have 5, 6, and 7 as consecutive integers whose product is 210. So, our answer is $5+6+7=\\boxed{18}$."
