    "problem": "The larger of two consecutive odd integers is three times the smaller.  What is their sum?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the smaller of the integers be $x$.  Then the larger is $x + 2$. So $x + 2 = 3x$, from which $x = 1$.  Thus the two integers are 1 and 3, and their sum is $\\boxed{4}$."
