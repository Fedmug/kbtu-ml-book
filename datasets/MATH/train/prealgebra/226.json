    "problem": "A rectangular garden 50 feet long and 10 feet wide is enclosed by a fence. To make the garden larger, while using the same fence, its shape is changed to a square. By how many square feet does this enlarge the garden?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The area of the garden was 500 square feet$(50\\times 10)$ and its perimeter was 120 feet, $2\\times (50+10)$. The square garden is also enclosed by 120 feet of fence so its sides are each 30 feet long. The square garden's area is 900 square feet ($30\\times 30)$. and this has increased the garden area by $\\boxed{400}$ square feet.
