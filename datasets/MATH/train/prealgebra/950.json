    "problem": "The five-digit number $246\\underline{\\hspace{5pt}}8$ is divisible by 9. What is the missing digit?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "In order for a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Since $2+4+6+8=20$, the only value of the missing digit that causes the sum of the digits to equal a multiple of 9 is $\\boxed{7}$, as $27=9\\cdot 3$."
