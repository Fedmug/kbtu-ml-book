    "problem": "How many whole numbers lie in the interval between $\\frac{5}{3}$ and $2\\pi$ ?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The smallest whole number in the interval is 2 because $\\frac{5}{3}$ is more than 1 but less than 2. The largest whole number in the interval is 6 because $2\\pi$ is more than 6 but less than 7. There are $\\boxed{5}$ whole numbers in the interval. They are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6."
