    "problem": "What is the degree measure of the smaller angle between the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock at exactly 2:30 p.m. on a 12-hour analog clock?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "[asy]\nunitsize(0.8inch);\nfor (int i=0 ; i<=11 ;++i)\n{\ndraw((rotate(i*30)*(0.8,0)) -- (rotate(i*30)*(1,0)));\nlabel(format(\"%d\",i+1),(rotate(60 - i*30)*(0.68,0)));\n}\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1),linewidth(1.1));\ndraw((0,-0.7)--(0,0)--(rotate(15)*(0.5,0)),linewidth(1.2));\n[/asy]\n\nThere are 12 hours on a clock, so each hour mark is $360^\\circ/12 = 30^\\circ$ from its neighbors.  At 2:30, the minute hand points at the 6, while the hour hand is mid-way between the 2 and the 3.  Therefore, the hour hand is $\\frac12\\cdot 30^\\circ = 15^\\circ$ from the 3 on the clock, and there are $3\\cdot 30^\\circ = 90^\\circ$ between the 3 and the 6 on the clock.  So, the hour and the minute hand are $15^\\circ + 90^\\circ =\\boxed{105^\\circ}$ apart."
