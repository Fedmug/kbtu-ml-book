    "problem": "An ellipse is drawn with major and minor axes of lengths 10 and 8 respectively.  Using one focus as a center, a circle is drawn that is tangent to the ellipse, with no part of the circle being outside the ellipse.  Compute the radius of the circle.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Place the ellipse in the coordinate plane, as usual, so that the center is at the origin.  Then the equation of the ellipse is\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{25} + \\frac{y^2}{16} = 1.\\]Also, the distance from the center to each foci is $\\sqrt{5^2 - 4^2} = 3,$ so one foci is at $F = (3,0).$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.6 cm);\n\npath ell = xscale(5)*yscale(4)*Circle((0,0),1);\npair F = (3,0);\n\ndraw(ell);\ndraw(Circle(F,2));\ndraw((-5,0)--(5,0));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,4));\n\ndot(\"$F = (3,0)$\", F, S);\n[/asy]\n\nConsider the circle centered at $F$ with radius 2.  The equation of this circle is $(x - 3)^2 + y^2 = 4,$ so $y^2 = 4 - (x - 3)^2.$  Substituting into the equation of the ellipse, we get\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{25} + \\frac{4 - (x - 3)^2}{16} = 1.\\]This simplifies to $3x^2 - 50x + 175 = 0,$ which factors as $(x - 5)(3x - 35) = 0.$  The solutions are $x = 5$ and $x = \\frac{35}{3},$ the latter root being extraneous.  This tells us that the ellipse and circle intersect only at the point $(5,0),$ and clearly we cannot draw a larger circle.\n\nHence, the maximum radius is $\\boxed{2}.$"
