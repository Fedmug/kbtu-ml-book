    "problem": "Find all real values of $x$ that satisfy \\[\\frac{1}{x^2+1} > \\frac{3}{x} + \\frac{17}{10}.\\](Give your answer in interval notation.)",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Rewriting the right-hand side under a common denominator, we have \\[\\frac{1}{x^2+1} > \\frac{30+17x}{10x}.\\]Then we can write \\[\\frac{1}{x^2+1} - \\frac{30+17x}{10x} > 0,\\]or \\[\\frac{-17x^3-30x^2-7x-30}{10x(x^2+1)} > 0.\\]Multiplying both sides by $-10$ and flipping the inequality sign, we get \\[\\frac{17x^3+30x^2+7x+30}{x(x^2+1)} < 0.\\]Looking for rational roots of the numerator, we see that $x=-2$ makes the numerator zero, so $x+2$ is a factor, by the factor theorem. Doing the polynomial division, we have \\[17x^3 + 30x^2 + 7x + 30 = (x+2)(17x^2-4x+15),\\]so \\[\\frac{(x+2)(17x^2-4x+15)}{x(x^2+1)} < 0.\\]Since $x^2+1$ is positive for all real numbers $x$, it does not affect the sign on the left side. Similarly, since $y=17x^2-4x+15$ is the graph of a parabola that opens upward, and its disciminant is $4^2 - 4 \\cdot 17 \\cdot 15,$ which is negative, we see that $17x^2-4x+15 > 0$ for all $x.$ Therefore, the given inequality is equivalent to \\[\\frac{x+2}{x} < 0.\\]Letting $f(x) = \\frac{x+2}{x},$ we construct a sign table: \\begin{tabular}{c|cc|c} &$x+2$ &$x$ &$f(x)$ \\\\ \\hline$x<-2$ &$-$&$-$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$-2<x<0$ &$+$&$-$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$x>0$ &$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]\\end{tabular}Therefore, $f(x) < 0$ when $x \\in \\boxed{(-2, 0)}.$"
