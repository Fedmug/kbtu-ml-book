    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Combining the terms on the right-hand side, we have \\[\\frac{x^2}{x+1} \\ge \\frac{5x+3}{4(x-1)}.\\]Then, moving all the terms to the left-hand side and combining denominators again, we get \\[\\begin{aligned} \\frac{x^2}{x+1} - \\frac{5x+3}{4(x-1)} &\\ge 0 \\\\ \\frac{4x^2(x-1)-(x+1)(5x+3)}{(x+1)(x-1)} &\\ge 0 \\\\ \\frac{4x^3-9x^2-8x-3}{(x+1)(x-1)} &\\ge 0. \\end{aligned}\\]We try to factor the numerator. Using the rational root theorem to test for rational roots, we see that $x=3$ is a root of $4x^3-9x^2-8x-3.$ Then, doing the polynomial division gives \\[4x^3-9x^2-8x-3 = (x-3)(4x^2+3x+1),\\]so we have \\[\\frac{(x-3)(4x^2+3x+1)}{(x+1)(x-1)} \\ge 0.\\]Since $4x^2+3x+1$ has a positive $x^2$ coefficient, and its discriminant is $3^2 - 4 \\cdot 4= -7,$ which is negative, it follows that $4x^2 + 3x + 1 > 0$ for all $x.$ Thus, the above inequality is equivalent to \\[f(x) = \\frac{x-3}{(x+1)(x-1)} \\ge 0.\\]We make a sign table for $f(x)$: \\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$x-3$ &$x+1$ &$x-1$ &$f(x)$ \\\\ \\hline$x<-1$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$-1<x<1$ &$-$&$+$&$-$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$1<x<3$ &$-$&$+$&$+$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$x>3$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]\\end{tabular}We see that $f(x) > 0$ when $-1 < x < 1$ or $x > 3.$ Since the inequality is nonstrict, we also include the values of $x$ such that $f(x) = 0,$ that is, only $x = 3.$ Therefore, the solution to the inequality is \\[x \\in \\boxed{(-1, 1) \\cup [3, \\infty)}.\\]"
