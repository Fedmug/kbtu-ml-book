    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Because $g$ is defined piecewise, we take cases. If $x < 0,$ then we have $3x + 6 = 3,$ which gives $x = -1.$ Since $-1 < 0,$ this is a valid solution. If $x \\ge 0,$ then we have $2x - 13 = 3,$ which gives $x = 8.$ Since $8 \\ge 0,$ this is a valid solution.\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation are $x = \\boxed{-1, 8}.$"
