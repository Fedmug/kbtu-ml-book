(The sum of the first few terms of an infinite series is called a partial sum.)  For example, when we add the first three terms of the series, we obtain a fraction whose denominator is\n\\[(5 + 1)(5^2 + 1)(5^4 + 1).\\]We can make this product nicely collapse by multiplying it by $5 - 1$:\n\\begin{align*}\n(5 - 1)(5 + 1)(5^2 + 1)(5^4 + 1) &= (5^2 - 1)(5^2 + 1)(5^4 + 1) \\\\\n&= (5^4 - 1)(5^4 + 1) \\\\\n&= 5^8 - 1.\n\\end{align*}More generally, if we add the first $n$ terms of the series, we can obtain a fraction with denominator $5^{2^n} - 1.$  The next term in the series has a denominator of $5^{2^n} + 1.$  Since we want the sum to telescope, we can consider the difference\n\\[\\frac{1}{5^{2^n} + 1} - \\frac{1}{5^{2^n} - 1} = \\frac{2}{5^{2^{n + 1}} - 1}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $2^n,$ we get\n\\[\\frac{2^n}{5^{2^n} + 1} - \\frac{2^n}{5^{2^n} - 1} = \\frac{2^{n + 1}}{5^{2^{n + 1}} - 1}.\\]Thus,\n\\[\\frac{2^n}{5^{2^n} + 1} = \\frac{2^n}{5^{2^n} - 1} - \\frac{2^{n + 1}}{5^{2^{n + 1}} - 1}.\\]The given series then telescopes as follows:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{5 + 1} + \\frac{2}{5^2 + 1} + \\frac{4}{5^4 + 1} + \\dotsb &= \\left( \\frac{1}{5 - 1} - \\frac{2}{5^2 - 1} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{2}{5^2 - 1} - \\frac{4}{5^4 - 1} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{4}{5^4 - 1} - \\frac{8}{5^8 - 1} \\right) + \\dotsb \\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}.\n\\end{align*}"
