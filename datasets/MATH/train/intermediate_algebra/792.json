    "solution": "First, consider the tangent line to the parabola at $(2,4).$  The equation of this tangent is of the form\n\\[y - 4 = m(x - 2).\\]Setting $y = x^2,$ we get $x^2 - 4 = m(x - 2),$ or $x^2 - mx + 2m - 4 = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, $x = 2$ is a double root of this quadratic.  In other words, this quadratic is identical to $(x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4.$  Hence, $m = 4.$\n\nLet the center of the circle be $(a,b).$  The line joining the center $(a,b)$ and $(2,4)$ is the perpendicular to the tangent line, which means its slope is $-\\frac{1}{4}.$  This gives us the equation\n\\[\\frac{b - 4}{a - 2} = -\\frac{1}{4}.\\]Since the points $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$ are on the circle, they must be equidistant from its center. The set of all points equidistant from $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$ is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$. Therefore, the center of the circle must lie on the  perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining $(2,4)$ and $(0,1)$. The midpoint of this line segment is $\\left( 1, \\frac{5}{2} \\right),$ and its slope is\n\\[\\frac{4 - 1}{2 - 0} = \\frac{3}{2}.\\]Hence, $(a,b)$ must satisfy\n\\[\\frac{b - 5/2}{a - 1} = -\\frac{2}{3}.\\]So,\n\\begin{align*}\nb - 4 &= -\\frac{1}{4} (a - 2), \\\\\nb - \\frac{5}{2} &= -\\frac{2}{3} (a - 1).\n\\end{align*}Solving this system, we find $(a,b) = \\boxed{\\left( -\\frac{16}{5}, \\frac{53}{10} \\right)}.$"
