    "problem": "How many ordered pairs of real numbers $(x,y)$ satisfy the following system of equations? \\[\\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} x+3y&=3 \\\\ \\left| |x| - |y| \\right| &= 1 \\end{aligned}\\right.\\]",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We try graphing both equations in the $xy-$plane. The graph of $x+3y=3$ is a line passing through $(3,0)$ and $(0,1).$ To graph $\\left| |x|- |y| \\right| = 1,$ notice that the equation does not change if we replace $x$ by $-x$ or if we replace $y$ by $-y.$ Thus, the graph of $\\left| |x|- |y| \\right| = 1$ is symmetric about the $y-$axis and the $x-$axis, so if we graph the equation in just the first quadrant, we can produce the remainder of the graph by reflecting it over the axes.\n\nIf $(x, y)$ lies in the first quadrant, then $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0,$ so the equation $\\left| |x|- |y| \\right| = 1$ becomes just $|x-y| = 1.$ Therefore, either $x-y = 1$ or $y-x = 1,$ whose graphs in the first quadrant are rays. This gives us the whole graph of $\\left| |x|- |y| \\right| = 1:$\n[asy]\nsize(8cm);\ndraw((0,1)--(3,4),blue,EndArrow);\ndraw((1,0)--(4,3),blue,EndArrow);\ndraw((0,-1)--(3,-4),blue,EndArrow);\ndraw((1,0)--(4,-3),blue,EndArrow);\ndraw((0,1)--(-3,4),blue,EndArrow);\ndraw((-1,0)--(-4,3),blue,EndArrow);\ndraw((0,-1)--(-3,-4),blue,EndArrow);\ndraw((-1,0)--(-4,-3),blue,EndArrow);\ndraw((-5,0)--(5,0),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,5),EndArrow);\ndraw((-4,7/3)--(4,-1/3),red,Arrows);\ndot((0,1)^^(-3,2)^^(1.5,0.5));\nfor (int i=-4; i<=4; ++i) draw((i,-0.15)--(i,0.15)^^(-0.15,i)--(0.15,i));\nlabel(\"$x$\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,5),N);\n[/asy]\n(The graph of $\\left||x|-|y|\\right|=1$ is drawn in blue, and the line $x+3y=3$ is drawn in red.) We see that the two graphs intersect at $\\boxed{3}$ points."
