    "solution": "We first unpack the statement $x < -4$ or $|x- 25 | \\le 1.$ The inequality $|x-25| \\le 1$ is equivalent to $-1 \\le x-25 \\le 1,$ which is in turn equivalent to $24 \\le x \\le 26.$ Therefore, we have either $x < -4$ or $24 \\le x \\le 26,$ so the solution set for $x$ is \\[(-\\infty, -4) \\cup [24, 26].\\]The sign of the expression $\\frac{(x-a)(x-b)}{x-c}$ changes at $x = a,$ $x = b,$ and $x = c,$ which means that $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ must be the numbers $-4,$ $24,$ and $26,$ in some order. Furthermore, since $24$ and $26$ are endpoints of a closed interval (that is, they are included in the solution set), it must be the case that $a$ and $b$ are $24$ and $26$ in some order, because the inequality is true when $x=a$ or $x=b,$ but is not true when $x=c$ (since that would make the denominator zero). Since $a < b,$ we have $a = 24$ and $b = 26,$ and then $c = -4.$\n\nIn conclusion, the given inequality must be \\[\\frac{(x-24)(x-26)}{x+4} \\le 0.\\]To check that the solution to this inequality is $(-\\infty, -4) \\cup [24, 26],$ we can build a sign table, where $f(x)$ is the expression on the left-hand side:  \\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$x-24$ &$x-26$ &$x+4$ &$f(x)$ \\\\ \\hline$x<-4$ &$-$&$-$&$-$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$-4<x<24$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$24<x<26$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$x>26$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]\\end{tabular}This shows that $f(x) < 0$ when $x \\in (-\\infty, -4) \\cup (24, 26),$ and since $f(x) = 0$ for $x \\in \\{24, 26\\},$ we indeed have the solution set \\[x \\in (-\\infty, -4) \\cup [24, 26].\\]Thus, $a+2b+3c=24+2(26) + 3(-4) = \\boxed{64}.$"
