These four complex numbers are plotted in the complex plane.  Find the area of the quadrilateral formed by the four complex numbers as vertices.",

    "solution": "Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are integers.  Then\n\\begin{align*}\nz \\overline{z}^3 + \\overline{z} z^3 &= z \\overline{z} (z^2 + \\overline{z}^2) \\\\\n&= |z|^2 ((x + yi)^2 + (x - yi)^2) \\\\\n&= (x^2 + y^2)(x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 + x^2 - 2xyi - y^2) \\\\\n&= (x^2 + y^2)(2x^2 - 2y^2) = 350,\n\\end{align*}so $(x^2 + y^2)(x^2 - y^2) = 175.$\n\nSince $x^2 + y^2$ is positive, $x^2 - y^2$ is also positive.  So we seek the ways to write 175 as the product of two positive integers.  Also, $x^2 + y^2 > x^2 - y^2,$ which gives us the following ways:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \nx^2 + y^2 & x^2 - y^2 & x^2 & y^2 \\\\ \\hline\n175 & 1 & 88 & 87 \\\\\n35 & 5 & 20 & 15 \\\\\n25 & 7 & 16 & 9\n\\end{array}\n\\]The only possibility is $x^2 = 16$ and $y^2 = 9.$  Then $x = \\pm 4$ and $y = \\pm 3,$ so the four complex numbers $z$ are $4 + 3i,$ $4 - 3i,$ $-4 + 3i,$ and $-4 - 3i.$  When we plot these in the complex plane, we get a rectangle whose dimensions are 6 and 8.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D;\n\nA = (4,3);\nB = (4,-3);\nC = (-4,-3);\nD = (-4,3);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\n\ndot(\"$4 + 3i$\", A, NE);\ndot(\"$4 - 3i$\", B, SE);\ndot(\"$-4 - 3i$\", C, SW);\ndot(\"$-4 + 3i$\", D, NW);\n[/asy]\n\nThe area of this rectangle is $6 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{48}.$"
