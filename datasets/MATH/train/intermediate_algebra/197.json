    "problem": "Find the distance between the vertices of the hyperbola\n\\[\\frac{y^2}{27} - \\frac{x^2}{11} = 1.\\]",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We read that $a^2 = 27,$ so $a = \\sqrt{27} = 3 \\sqrt{3}.$  Therefore, the distance between the vertices is $2a = \\boxed{6 \\sqrt{3}}.$"
