    "problem": "What is the domain of the function $g(x) = \\frac{3x+1}{x+8}$ ?  Enter your answer using interval notation.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The formula for $g(x)$ has a defined value unless its denominator is $0$; thus we must exclude $-8$ from the domain.  The domain of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, -8) \\cup (-8, \\infty)}$."
