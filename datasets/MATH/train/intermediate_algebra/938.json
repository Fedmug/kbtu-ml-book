    "problem": "Compute the product of the roots of the equation \\[3x^3 - x^2 - 20x + 27 = 0.\\]",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is the negation of the constant term divided by the leading ($x^3$) coefficient. Therefore, the answer is \\[\\frac{-27}{3} = \\boxed{-9}.\\](Don't forget to divide by the leading coefficient of the polynomial!)"
