    "solution": "If the graph of $f(x)$ is continuous, the two pieces of the function must meet at $x=n$. In order for this to happen, we know that $n^2+2=2n+5$. Moving all the terms to one side, we are left with the quadratic $n^2-2n-3=0$. Vieta's formulas tell us that the sum of the roots of a quadratic in the form of $ax^2+bx+c$ is just $-\\frac{b}{a}$. Since the roots of this quadratic are the only possible values of $n$, our final answer is $-\\frac{2}{1}=\\boxed{2}$."
