    "problem": "For certain real values of $a, b, c,$ and $d_{},$ the equation $x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0$ has four non-real roots. The product of two of these roots is $13+i$ and the sum of the other two roots is $3+4i,$ where $i^2 = -1.$ Find $b.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the coefficients of the polynomial are all real, the four non-real roots must come in two conjugate pairs. Let $z$ and $w$ be the two roots that multiply to $13+i$. Since $13+i$ is not real, $z$ and $w$ cannot be conjugates of each other (since any complex number times its conjugate is a real number). Therefore, the other two roots must be $\\overline{z}$ and $\\overline{w}$, the conjugates of $z$ and $w$. Therefore, we have \\[zw = 13+i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\overline{z} + \\overline{w} = 3+4i.\\]To find $b$, we use Vieta's formulas: $b$ equals the second symmetric sum of the roots, which is \\[b = zw + z\\overline{z} + z\\overline{w} + w\\overline{z} + w\\overline{w} + \\overline{z} \\cdot \\overline{w}.\\]To evaluate this expression, we first recognize the terms $zw$ and $\\overline{z} \\cdot \\overline{w}$. We have $zw = 13+i$, so $\\overline{z} \\cdot \\overline{w} = \\overline{zw} = 13-i$. Thus, \\[b = 26 +  (z\\overline{z} + z\\overline{w} + w\\overline{z} + w\\overline{w}).\\]To finish, we can factor the remaining terms by grouping: \\[ b = 26 + (z+w)(\\overline{z}+\\overline{w}).\\]From $\\overline{z} + \\overline{w} = 3+4i$, we get $z + w = 3-4i$. Thus, \\[b = 26 + (3-4i)(3+4i) = \\boxed{51}.\\]"
