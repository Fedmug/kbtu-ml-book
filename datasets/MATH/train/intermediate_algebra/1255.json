    "problem": "In an increasing sequence of four positive integers, the first three terms form an arithmetic progression, the last three terms form a geometric progression, and the first and fourth terms differ by $30.$ Find the sum of the four terms.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Denote the first three terms by $a,$ $a+d,$ and $a+2d,$ where $a$ and $d$ are positive integers; then the fourth term is $a+30.$ Since the last three terms form an arithmetic sequence, we have \\[(a+d)(a+30) = (a+2d)^2,\\]or \\[a^2 + (30+d) a + 30d = a^2 + 4ad + 4d^2.\\]Solving for $a,$ we get \\[a = \\frac{4d^2-30d}{30-3d} = \\frac{2d(2d-15)}{3(10-d)}.\\]Since $a$ is positive, we must have $f(d) = \\frac{d(2d-15)}{10-d} > 0.$ We construct a sign table for this expression: \\begin{tabular}{c|ccc|c} &$d$ &$2d-15$ &$-d+10$ &$f(d)$ \\\\ \\hline$d<0$ &$-$&$-$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$0<d<\\frac{15}{2}$ &$+$&$-$&$+$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]$\\frac{15}{2}<d<10$ &$+$&$+$&$+$&$+$\\\\ [.1cm]$d>10$ &$+$&$+$&$-$&$-$\\\\ [.1cm]\\end{tabular}Since $d > 0,$ we must have $\\tfrac{15}{2} < d < 10,$ which only gives two possible integer values for $d,$ namely $8$ and $9.$ For $d=8,$ we get \\[a = \\frac{2 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 1}{3 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{8}{3},\\]which is not an integer, so we must have $d=9$ and \\[a = \\frac{2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 3}{3 \\cdot 1} = 18.\\]Then the sum of the four terms is \\[a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+30) = 18 + 27 + 36 + 48 = \\boxed{129}.\\]"
