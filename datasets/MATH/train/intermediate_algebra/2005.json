    "solution": "Expanding both sides gives \\[z^3 - (r+s+t)z^2 + (rs+st+rt)z - rst = z^3 - c(r+s+t)z^2 + c^2(rs+st+rt)z - c^3rst.\\]Since this equation holds for all $z,$ we must have \\[\\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} -(r+s+t) &= -c(r+s+t), \\\\ rs+st+rt &= c^2(rs+st+rt), \\\\ -rst &= -c^3rst. \\end{aligned} \\right.\\]If none of $c, c^2, c^3$ are equal to $1,$ then these equations imply that \\[r + s + t = rs + st + rt = rst = 0.\\]Then $r, s, t$ are the roots of the polynomial $z^3 - 0z^2 - 0z - 0 = z^3,$ so $r = s = t = 0,$ which contradicts the fact that $r, s, t$ must be distinct. Therefore, at least one of the numbers $c, c^2, c^3$ must be equal to $1.$\n\nIf $c = 1,$ then all three equations are satisfied for any values of $r, s, t.$ If $c^2 = 1,$ then the equations are satisfied when $(r, s, t) = (0, 1, -1).$ If $c^3 = 1,$ then the equations are satisfied when $(r, s, t) = \\left(1, -\\tfrac{1}{2} + \\tfrac{\\sqrt3}{2}i, -\\tfrac{1}{2} - \\tfrac{\\sqrt3}{2}i\\right).$ Therefore, all such $c$ work. The equations $c = 1,$ $c^2 = 1,$ and $c^3 = 1$ have a total of $1+2+3=6$ roots, but since $c=1$ satisfies all three of them, it is counted three times, so the number of possible values of $c$ is $6 - 2 = \\boxed{4}.$"
