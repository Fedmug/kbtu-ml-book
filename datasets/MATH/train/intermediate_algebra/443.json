    "solution": "We can factor by pairing $x^5$ and $-x,$ and $-x^2$ and $-1$:\n\\begin{align*}\nx^5 - x^2 - x - 1 &= (x^5 - x) - (x^2 + 1) \\\\\n&= x(x^4 - 1) - (x^2 + 1) \\\\\n&= x(x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) - (x^2 + 1) \\\\\n&= (x^2 + 1)(x^3 - x - 1).\n\\end{align*}If $x^3 - x - 1$ factors further, then it must have a linear factor, which means it has an integer root.  By the Integer Root Theorem, the only possible integer roots are $\\pm 1,$ and neither of these work, so $x^3 - x - 1$ is irreducible.\n\nThus, $(x^2 + 1)(x^3 - x - 1)$ is the complete factorization.  Evaluating each factor at 2, we get $(2^2 + 1) + (2^3 - 2 - 1) = \\boxed{10}.$"
