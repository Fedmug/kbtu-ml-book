    "problem": "A hyperbola has its two foci at $(5, 0)$ and $(9, 4).$ Find the coordinates of its center.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The center lies at the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two foci, so the center has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{5+9}{2}, \\frac{0+4}{2}\\right) = \\boxed{(7,2)}.$"
