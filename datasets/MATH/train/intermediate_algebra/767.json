    "problem": "For what positive value of $n$ does $|3+ni|=3\\sqrt{10}$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $3\\sqrt{10}=|3+ni|=\\sqrt{3^2+n^2}$. Squaring both sides gives $90 = 9 +n^2$, from which we quickly get our solution of $n=\\boxed{9}$."
