    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $p(x) = x^2-4x+3$. A number $c$ is not in the domain of $g$ if and only if $p(c) = 0$. Hence we have,\n$$c^2-4c+3=0.$$Factoring gives us\n$$(c-3)(c-1) = 0.$$Solving for $c$ gives us $1$ and $3$. Hence the domain of $g$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty, 1) \\cup (1, 3) \\cup (3, \\infty)} $."
