    "problem": "In a certain sequence the first term is $a_1 = 2007$ and the second term is $a_2 = 2008.$  Furthermore, the values of the remaining terms are chosen so that\n\\[a_n + a_{n + 1} + a_{n + 2} = n\\]for all $n \\ge 1.$  Determine $a_{1000}.$",

    "solution": "We know that $a_n + a_{n + 1} + a_{n + 2} = n$ and $a_{n - 1} + a_n + a_{n + 1} = n - 1.$  Subtracting these equations, we get\n\\[a_{n + 2} - a_{n - 1} = 1,\\]so $a_{n + 2} = a_{n - 1} + 1.$\n\nHence, the terms\n\\[a_1 = 2007, \\ a_4, \\ a_7, \\ a_{10}, \\ \\dots, \\ a_{1000}\\]form an arithmetic sequence with common difference 1.  The common difference of 1 is added $\\frac{1000 - 1}{3} = 333$ times, so $a_{1000} = 2007 + 333 = \\boxed{2340}.$"
