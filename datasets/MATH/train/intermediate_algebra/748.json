    "problem": "A parabola and an ellipse share a focus, and the directrix of the parabola is the line containing the minor axis of the ellipse. The parabola and ellipse intersect at two points. Given that the equation of the ellipse is $\\frac{x^2}{25} + \\frac{y^2}{9} = 1,$ find the distance between those two points.",

    "solution": "The lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axis are $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ and $\\sqrt{9} = 3.$ Then the distance from the center $(0,0)$ of the ellipse to each focus is $\\sqrt{5^2-3^2} = 4,$ so the foci have coordinates $(\\pm4, 0).$\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume that the parabola has its focus at $(4,0).$ Its directrix is the line containing the minor axis, which is the $y-$axis. Then the vertex of the parabola must be the point $(2,0),$ so its equation is of the form \\[x = Ay^2 + 2\\]for some value of $A.$ Since the distance from the vertex to the focus is $2,$ we have $2 = \\tfrac{1}{4A},$ so $A = \\tfrac{1}{8},$ and the equation of the parabola is \\[x = \\frac{y^2}8 + 2.\\]The parabola and ellipse are shown together below.
