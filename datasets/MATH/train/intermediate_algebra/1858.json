    "problem": "Find the focus of the parabola $y = 4x^2 - 3.$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix.  To make the algebra a bit easier, we can find the focus of the parabola $y = 4x^2,$ and then shift it downward 3 units to find the focus of the parabola $y = 4x^2 - 3.$\n\nSince the parabola $y = 4x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\npair F, P, Q;\n\nF = (0,1/4);\nP = (1,1);\nQ = (1,-1/4);\n\nreal parab (real x) {\n  return(x^2);\n}\n\ndraw(graph(parab,-1.5,1.5),red);\ndraw((-1.5,-1/4)--(1.5,-1/4),dashed);\ndraw(P--F);\ndraw(P--Q);\n\ndot(\"$F$\", F, NW);\ndot(\"$P$\", P, E);\ndot(\"$Q$\", Q, S);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $(x,4x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = 4x^2.$  Then\n\\[PF^2 = x^2 + (4x^2 - f)^2\\]and $PQ^2 = (4x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus,\n\\[x^2 + (4x^2 - f)^2 = (4x^2 - d)^2.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[x^2 + 16x^4 - 8fx^2 + f^2 = 16x^4 - 8dx^2 + d^2.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1 - 8f &= -8d, \\\\\nf^2 &= d^2.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $f - d = \\frac{1}{8}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $2f = \\frac{1}{8},$ so $f = \\frac{1}{16}.$\n\nThus, the focus of $y = 4x^2$ is $\\left( 0, \\frac{1}{16} \\right),$ so the focus of $y = 4x^2 - 3$ is $\\boxed{\\left( 0, -\\frac{47}{16} \\right)}.$"
