    "problem": "Compute the sum of the number $10 - \\sqrt{2018}$ and its radical conjugate.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The radical conjugate of this number is $10 + \\sqrt{2018},$ so when we add them, the radical parts cancel, giving $10 + 10 = \\boxed{20}.$"
