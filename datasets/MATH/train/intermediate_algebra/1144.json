    "solution": "Since $PA + PD = 8,$ point $P$ must lie on the ellipse whose foci are $A$ and $D,$ and whose major axis has length $8.$ Since the distance between the foci is $3 - (-3) = 6,$ the minor axis has length $\\sqrt{8^2 - 6^2} = 2\\sqrt{7}.$ Then the semi-axes have lengths $4$ and $\\sqrt{7},$ respectively, and the center of the ellipse is $(0,0),$ so the equation of this ellipse is \\[\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{7} = 1.\\]Similarly, since $PB+PC=8,$ point $P$ must lie on the ellipse whose foci are $B$ and $C,$ and whose major axis has length $8.$ Since the distance between the foci is $2-(-2) = 4,$ the minor axis has length $\\sqrt{8^2-4^2} = 4\\sqrt{3}.$ Then the semi-axes have lengths $4$ and $2\\sqrt{3},$ respectively, and the center of the ellipse is $(0,1),$ so the equation of this ellipse is \\[\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{12} = 1.\\]Both ellipses are shown below. (Note that they intersect at two different points, but that they appear to have the same $y-$coordinate.)

Since $\\sqrt{21} > 4,$ we have \\[\\frac{-7 - 2\\sqrt{21}}{5} < \\frac{-7 -2 \\cdot 4}{5} = -3.\\]But the smallest possible value of $y$ for a point on the ellipse $\\frac{x^2}{16} + \\frac{y^2}{7} = 1$ is $-\\sqrt{7},$ which is greater than $-3.$ Therefore, we must choose the $+$ sign, and so \\[y = \\frac{-7 + 2\\sqrt{21}}{5}.\\]The final answer is $7 + 2 + 21 + 5 = \\boxed{35}.$"
