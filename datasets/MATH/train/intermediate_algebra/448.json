    "problem": "The polynomial equation \\[x^3 + bx + c = 0,\\]where $b$ and $c$ are rational numbers, has $3-\\sqrt{7}$ as a root. It also has an integer root. What is it?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Because the coefficients of the polynomial are rational, the radical conjugate of $3-\\sqrt{7}$, which is $3+\\sqrt{7}$, must also be a root of the polynomial. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this polynomial is $0$; since $(3-\\sqrt{7}) + (3+\\sqrt{7}) = 6,$ the third, integer root must be $0 - 6 = \\boxed{-6}.$"
