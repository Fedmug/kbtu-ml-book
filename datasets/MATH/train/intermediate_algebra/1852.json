    "solution": "Writing out the equation $f(f(x)) = x$, we have \\[f\\left(\\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}\\right) = x \\implies \\frac{a \\cdot \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d} + b}{c \\cdot \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d} + d} = x \\implies \\frac{a(ax+b)+b(cx+d)}{c(ax+b)+d(cx+d)} = x\\]or \\[(a^2+bc)x + (ab+bd) = (ac+cd)x^2 + (bc+d^2)x.\\]Since this equation holds for infinitely many distinct values of $x$, the corresponding coefficients must be equal. Thus, \\[ab+bd = 0, \\quad a^2+bc = bc+d^2, \\quad ac+cd=0.\\]Since $b$ and $c$ are nonzero, the first and last equations simplify to $a +d=0$, so $d=-a$, and then the second equation is automatically satisfied. Therefore, all we have from $f(f(x)) = x$ is $d=-a$. That is, \\[f(x) = \\frac{ax+b}{cx-a}.\\]Now, using $f(19) = 19$ and $f(97) = 97$, we get \\[19 = \\frac{19a+b}{19c-a} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 97 = \\frac{97a+b}{97c-a}.\\]These equations become \\[b = 19^2 c - 2\\cdot 19 a = 97^2 c - 2 \\cdot 97 a.\\]At this point, we look at what we want to find: the unique number not in the range of $f$. To find this number, we try to find an expression for $f^{-1}(x)$. If $f(x) = \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}$, then $cxf(x) + df(x) = ax+b$, so $x(a-cf(x)) = df(x) - b$, and so $x = \\frac{df(x)-b}{a-cf(x)}$. Thus, \\[f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{dx-b}{a-cx}.\\]Since $x = a/c$ is not in the domain of $f^{-1}(x)$, we see that $a/c$ is not in the range of $f(x)$.\n\nNow we can find $a/c$: we have \\[19^2 c - 2 \\cdot 19 a = 97^2 c - 2 \\cdot 97 a,\\]so \\[2 \\cdot(97-19) a = (97^2 - 19^2) c.\\]Thus \\[\\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{97^2-19^2}{2 \\cdot (97-19)} = \\frac{97+19}{2} = \\boxed{58}\\]by the difference of squares factorization."
