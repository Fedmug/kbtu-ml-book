    "solution": "From the given conditions, $|\\alpha^2 - 1| = 2 |\\alpha - 1|$ and $|\\alpha^4 - 1| = 4 |\\alpha - 1|.$  From the first equation,\n\\[|\\alpha + 1||\\alpha - 1| = 2 |\\alpha - 1|.\\]Since $\\alpha \\neq 1,$ $|\\alpha - 1| \\neq 0.$  Thus, we can safely cancel the factors of $|\\alpha - 1|,$ to get\n\\[|\\alpha + 1| = 2.\\]From the second equation,\n\\[|\\alpha^2 + 1||\\alpha^2 - 1| = 4 |\\alpha - 1|.\\]Then $2 |\\alpha^2 + 1||\\alpha - 1| = 4 |\\alpha - 1|,$ so\n\\[|\\alpha^2 + 1| = 2.\\]Let $\\alpha = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.  Then $\\alpha^2 = x^2 + 2xyi - y^2,$ so the equations $|\\alpha + 1| = 2$ and $|\\alpha^2 + 1| = 2$ becomes\n\\begin{align*}\n|x + yi + 1| &= 2, \\\\\n|x^2 + 2xyi - y^2 + 1| &= 2.\n\\end{align*}Hence,\n\\begin{align*}\n(x + 1)^2 + y^2 &= 4, \\\\\n(x^2 - y^2 + 1)^2 + (2xy)^2 &= 4.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $y^2 = 4 - (x + 1)^2 = 3 - 2x - x^2.$  Substituting into the second equation, we get\n\\[(x^2 - (3 - 2x - x^2) + 1)^2 + 4x^2 (3 - 2x - x^2) = 4.\\]This simplifies to $8x^2 - 8x = 0,$ which factors as $8x(x - 1) = 0.$  Hence, $x = 0$ or $x = 1.$\n\nIf $x = 0,$ then $y^2 = 3,$ so $y = \\pm \\sqrt{3}.$\n\nIf $x = 1,$ then $y^2 = 0,$ so $y = 0.$  But this leads to $\\alpha = 1,$ which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $\\alpha$ are $\\boxed{i \\sqrt{3}, -i \\sqrt{3}}.$\n\nAlternative: We can rewrite the second equation as $(x^2 + y^2 + 1)^2 - 4y^2 = 4.$  From the first equation, we have $x^2 + y^2 + 1 = 4 - 2x$ and $y^2 = 4 - (x + 1)^2.$  Substituting these, we get \\[ (4 - 2x)^2 - 4(4 - (x + 1)^2) = 4. \\]This simplifies to $8x^2 - 8x = 0,$ and we can continue as before."
