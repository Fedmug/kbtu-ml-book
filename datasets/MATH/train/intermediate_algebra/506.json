    "problem": "In a certain sequence the first term is $a_1=2007$ and the second term is $a_2=2008$.  Furthermore, the values of the remaining terms are chosen so that $a_n+a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}=n$ for all $n\\ge 1$.  Determine $a_{1000}$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "To get started, we compute the first ten terms as: \\[ 2007, 2008, -4014, 2008, 2009, -4013, 2009, 2010, -4012, 2010, \\ldots \\]It appears that each term is 1 greater than the number three terms previous.  We can demonstrate that this will always occur using the given recurrence relation.  We know that $a_n+a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}=n$ and that $a_{n+1}+a_{n+2}+a_{n+3}=n+1$.  Subtracting the former from the latter yields $a_{n+3}-a_n=1$, which is the pattern that we observed.  Therefore we find that \\[ a_1 = 2007, \\ a_4=2008, \\ a_7=2009, \\ldots, a_{1000}=2007+333=\\boxed{\\mathbf{2340}}. \\]"
