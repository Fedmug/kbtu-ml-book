    "solution": "Let $A = (a,a^2).$  Then the equation of the tangent at $A$ is of the form\n\\[y - a^2 = m(x - a).\\]Setting $y = x^2,$ we get $x^2 - a^2 = m(x - a),$ or $x^2 - mx + ma - a^2 = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, this quadratic will have a double root of $x = a$; in other words, this quadratic is identical to $x^2 - 2ax + a^2 = 0.$  Hence, $m = 2a.$\n\nTherefore, the equation of the tangent at $A$ is\n\\[y - a^2 = 2a(x - a).\\]Similarly, the equation of the tangent at $B$ is\n\\[y - b^2 = 2b(x - b).\\]To find the point of intersection $P,$ we set the value of $y$ equal to each other.  This gives us\n\\[2a(x - a) + a^2 = 2b(x - b) + b^2.\\]Then $2ax - a^2 = 2bx - b^2,$ so\n\\[(2a - 2b)x = a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b).\\]Since $a \\neq b,$ we can divide both sides by $2a - 2b,$ to get\n\\[x = \\frac{a + b}{2}.\\]Then\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= 2a(x - a) + a^2 \\\\\n&= 2a \\left( \\frac{a + b}{2} - a \\right) + a^2 \\\\\n&= a^2 + ab - 2a^2 + a^2 \\\\\n&= ab.\n\\end{align*}Note that the two tangents are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is $-1.$  This gives us $(2a)(2b) = -1.$  Hence, the $y$-coordinate of $P$ is always $ab = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{4}}.$  This means that the intersection point $P$ always lies on the directrix $y = -\\frac{1}{4}.$"
