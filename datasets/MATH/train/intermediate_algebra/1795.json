    "problem": "Let $S_n$ denote the sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence with common difference 3.  If $\\frac{S_{3n}}{S_n}$ is a constant that does not depend on $n,$ for all positive integers $n,$ then find the first term.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $a$ be the first term.  Then\n\\[S_n = \\frac{n [2a + (n - 1) 3]}{2}\\]and\n\\[S_{3n} = \\frac{3n [2a + (3n - 1) 3]}{2},\\]so\n\\[\\frac{S_{3n}}{S_n} = \\frac{\\frac{3n [2a + (3n - 1) 3]}{2}}{\\frac{n [2a + (n - 1) 3]}{2}} = \\frac{3(2a + 9n - 3)}{2a + 3n - 3} = \\frac{6a + 27n - 9}{2a + 3n - 3}.\\]Let this constant be $c,$ so\n\\[\\frac{6a + 27n - 9}{2a + 3n - 3} = c.\\]Then $6a + 27n - 9 = 2ac + 3cn - 3c.$  Since both sides are equal for all $n,$ the coefficients of $n$ must be equal.  In other words, $27 = 3c,$ so $c = 9.$  then $6a - 9 = 18a - 27.$  Solving, we find $a = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.$"
