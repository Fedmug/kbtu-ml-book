    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "After the subtractions are performed, each fraction in the pattern has a numerator that is one less than its denominator. The product then reduces quite nicely, leaving just the frst numerator and the last denominator, as follows: $\\frac{1}{2}\\times\\frac{2}{3}\\times\\frac{3}{4}\\times \\cdots\\times\\frac{49}{50} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$."
