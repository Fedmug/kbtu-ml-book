    "solution": "Let $S = g(1) + g(2) + \\dots + g(20).$  Then by definition of a tenuous function,\n\\begin{align*}\nS &= [g(20) + g(1)] + [g(19) + g(2)] + [g(18) + g(3)] + \\dots + [g(11) + g(10)] \\\\\n&\\ge (20^2 + 1) + (19^2 + 1) + (18^2 + 1) + \\dots + (11^2 + 1) \\\\\n&= 2495\n\\end{align*}Let's assume that $S = 2495,$ and try to find a function $g(x)$ that works.  Then we must have\n\\begin{align*}\ng(20) + g(1) &= 20^2 + 1, \\\\\ng(19) + g(2) &= 19^2 + 1, \\\\\ng(18) + g(3) &= 18^2 + 1, \\\\\n&\\dots, \\\\\ng(11) + g(10) &= 11^2 + 1.\n\\end{align*}If $g(1) < g(2),$ then\n\\[g(19) + g(1) < g(19) + g(2) = 19^2 + 1,\\]contradicting the fact that $g$ is tenuous.\n\nAnd if $g(1) > g(2),$ then\n\\[g(20) + g(2) < g(20) + g(1) = 20^2 + 1,\\]again contradicting the fact that $g$ is tenuous.  Therefore, we must have $g(1) = g(2).$\n\nIn the same way, we can prove that $g(1) = g(3),$ $g(1) = g(4),$ and so on, up to $g(1) = g(10).$  Hence,\n\\[g(1) = g(2) = \\dots = g(10).\\]Let $a = g(1) = g(2) = \\dots = g(10).$  Then $g(n) = n^2 + 1 - a$ for all $n \\ge 11.$  Since $g(11) + g(11) \\ge 122,$ $g(11) \\ge 61.$  But $g(11) = 121 + 1 - a = 122 - a \\le 61,$ so $a \\le 61.$  The smallest possible value of $g(14)$ is then $14^2 + 1 - 61 = \\boxed{136}.$"
