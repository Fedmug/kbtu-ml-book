    "problem": "The graph of \\[y^4 - 4x^4 = 2y^2 - 1\\]is the union of the graphs of two different conic sections. Which two types of conic sections are they?\n\n(Write your answer as a list, with \"C\" for circle, \"E\" for ellipse, \"H\" for hyperbola, and \"P\" for parabola. For example, \"C, H\" if you think the graph consists of a circle and a hyperbola. You may use a letter twice.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We can rewrite the given equation as \\[y^4 - 2y^2 + 1 = 4x^4.\\]The left-hand side is the perfect square of a binomial: \\[(y^2-1)^2 = 4x^4.\\]Therefore, either $y^2-1=2x^2$ or $y^2-1=-2x^2.$ That is, either $y^2-2x^2=1$ or $y^2+2x^2=1.$ These are the equations for a hyperbola and an ellipse, respectively, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{H, E}}.$"
