    "solution": "The graph of $y=f(x-2)$ is just the graph of $y=f(x)$ shifted two units to the right. To see this, note that if $(a,b)$ is a point on the graph of $y=f(x)$, then $(a+2,b)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x-2)$. Then the graph of $y=3f(x-2)$ is the graph of $y=f(x-2)$ scaled by a factor of 3 in the vertical direction. To see this, note that if $(a,b)$ is on the graph of $y=f(x-2)$, then $(a,3b)$ is on the graph of $y=3f(x-2)$. Stretching a region in the plane by a factor of 3 in one dimension increases its area by a factor of 3, so the area between the graph of $y=3f(x-2)$ and the $x$-axis is $\\boxed{30}$."
