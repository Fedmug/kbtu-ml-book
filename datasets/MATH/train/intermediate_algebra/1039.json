    "problem": "The expression \\[(x+y+z)^{2006}+(x-y-z)^{2006}\\]is simplified by expanding it and combining like terms. How many terms are in the simplified expression?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "There is exactly one term in the simplified expression for every monomial of the form $x^ay^bz^c$, where $a,b$, and $c$ are non-negative integers, $a$ is even, and $a+b+c=2006$.  There are 1004 even values of $a$ with $0\\leq a\\leq 2006$.  For each such value, $b$ can assume any of the $2007-a$ integer values between 0 and $2006-a$, inclusive, and the value of $c$ is then uniquely determined as $2006-a-b$.  Thus the number of terms in the simplified expression is \\[\n(2007-0)+(2007-2)+\\cdots +(2007-2006)=2007+2005+\\cdots +1.\n\\]This is the sum of the first 1004 odd positive integers, which is $\n1004^2=\\boxed{1{,}008{,}016}.\n$\n\n\\[ OR \\]The given expression is equal to \\[\n\\sum \\frac{2006!}{a!b!c!}\n\\left(x^ay^bz^c + x^a(-y)^b(-z)^c \\right),\n\\]where the sum is taken over all non-negative integers $a,b,$ and $c$ with $a+b+c=2006$. Because the number of non-negative integer solutions of $a+b+c=k$ is $\\binom{k+2}{2}$, the sum is taken over $\\binom{2008}{2}$ terms, but those for which $b$ and $c$ have opposite parity have a sum of zero. If $b$ is odd and $c$ is even, then $a$ is odd, so $a=2A+1,b=2B+1,\n\\text{ and }c=2C$ for some non-negative integers $A,B,\\text{ and }C$. Therefore $2A+1+2B+1+2C=2006$, so $A+B+C=1002$. Because the last equation has $\\binom{1004}{2}$ non-negative integer solutions, there are $\\binom{1004}{2}$ terms for which $b$ is odd and $c$ is even. The number of terms for which $b$ is even and $c$ is odd is the same. Thus the number of terms in the simplified expression is \\[\\binom{2008}{2}-2\\binom{1004}{2} = 1004\\cdot 2007 - 1004\\cdot 1003 =\n1004^2 = \\boxed{1{,}008{,}016}.\\]"
