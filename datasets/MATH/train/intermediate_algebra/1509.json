    "solution": "The vertical asymptote of $f(x)$ is $x = 2.$  Hence, $d = 2.$\n\nBy long division,\n\\[f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x - 2 - \\frac{2}{2x - 4}.\\]Thus, the oblique asymptote of $f(x)$ is $y = \\frac{1}{2} x - 2,$ which passes through $(0,-2).$  Therefore, the oblique asymptote of $g(x)$ is\n\\[y = -2x - 2.\\]Therefore,\n\\[g(x) = -2x - 2 + \\frac{k}{x - 2}\\]for some constant $k.$\n\nFinally,\n\\[f(-2) = \\frac{(-2)^2 - 6(-2) + 6}{2(-6) - 4} = -\\frac{11}{4},\\]so\n\\[g(-2) = -2(-2) - 2 + \\frac{k}{-2 - 2} = -\\frac{11}{4}.\\]Solving, we find $k = 19.$  Hence,\n\\[g(x) = -2x - 2 + \\frac{19}{x - 2} = \\frac{-2x^2 + 2x + 23}{x - 2}.\\]We want to solve\n\\[\\frac{x^2 - 6x + 6}{2x - 4} = \\frac{-2x^2 + 2x + 23}{x - 2}.\\]Then $x^2 - 6x + 6 = -4x^2 + 4x + 46,$ or $5x^2 - 10x - 40 = 0.$  This factors as $5(x + 2)(x - 4) = 0,$ so the other point of intersection occurs at $x = 4.$  Since\n\\[f(4) = \\frac{4^2 - 6 \\cdot 4 + 6}{2(4) - 4} = -\\frac{1}{2},\\]the other point of intersection is $\\boxed{\\left( 4, -\\frac{1}{2} \\right)}.$"
