    "problem": "Find the distance between the vertices of the hyperbola\n\\[\\frac{x^2}{99} - \\frac{y^2}{36} = 1.\\]",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We read that $a^2 = 99,$ so $a = \\sqrt{99} = 3 \\sqrt{11}.$  Therefore, the distance between the vertices is $2a = \\boxed{6 \\sqrt{11}}.$"
