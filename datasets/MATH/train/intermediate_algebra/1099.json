    "solution": "By symmetry, the vertices of the square are $(\\pm t, \\pm t)$ for some positive real number $t.$  Then\n\\[\\frac{t^2}{3} + \\frac{t^2}{6} = 1.\\]Solving, we find $t^2 = 2.$  Then $t = \\sqrt{2}.$\n\nThe side length of the square is then $2t = 2 \\sqrt{2},$ so its area is $(2 \\sqrt{2})^2 = \\boxed{8}.$"
