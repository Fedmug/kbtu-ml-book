    "problem": "The vertices of an equilateral triangle lie on the hyperbola $xy=1$, and a vertex of this hyperbola is the centroid of the triangle. What is the square of the area of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Without loss of generality, suppose that the centroid of the triangle is at the vertex $(-1,-1)$.  In an equilateral triangle, the centroid and the circumcenter coincide, so the three vertices of the triangle are among the intersection points of the hyperbola $xy = 1$ and a circle centered at $(-1,-1)$.\n\nSuppose the hyperbola and circle intersect at four distinct points, shown below on the left, at $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.  Either $A$ or $B$ are two of the vertices, or $C$ and $D$ are two of the vertices.  If $A$ and $B$ are two of the vertices, then the triangle will have the line $y = x$ as an axis of symmetry, which means that the third vertex must also lie on the line $y = x$.  However, neither of the other two points satisfy this condition.  The argument is the same if $C$ and $D$ are two of the vertices.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.8 cm);\n\nreal f(real x) {\n  return(1/x);\n}\n\npair A, B, C, D, trans = (9,0);\n\nA = intersectionpoints(Circle((-1,-1),3),graph(f,1/3,3))[0];\nB = intersectionpoints(Circle((-1,-1),3),graph(f,1/3,3))[1];\nC = intersectionpoints(Circle((-1,-1),3),graph(f,-5,-1/5))[0];\nD = intersectionpoints(Circle((-1,-1),3),graph(f,-5,-1/5))[1];\n\ndraw((-5,0)--(3,0));\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,3));\ndraw(graph(f,1/3,3),red);\ndraw(graph(f,-1/5,-5),red);\ndraw(Circle((-1,-1),3));\n\ndot(\"$A$\", A, NE);\ndot(\"$B$\", B, NE);\ndot(\"$C$\", C, SW);\ndot(\"$D$\", D, SW);\ndot(\"$(-1,-1)$\", (-1,-1), SW);\n\ndraw(shift(trans)*((-5,0)--(3,0)));\ndraw(shift(trans)*((0,-5)--(0,3)));\ndraw(shift(trans)*graph(f,1/3,3),red);\ndraw(shift(trans)*graph(f,-1/5,-5),red);\ndraw(Circle((-1,-1) + trans,2*sqrt(2)));\n\ndot(\"$(-1,-1)$\", (-1,-1) + trans, SW);\ndot(\"$(1,1)$\", (1,1) + trans, NE);\n[/asy]\n\nTherefore, the hyperbola must intersect the circle at exactly three points.  In turn, the only way this can happen is if the circle passes through the point $(1,1)$.  The circumradius of the triangle is then the distance between $(-1,-1)$ and $(1,1)$, which is $2 \\sqrt{2}$.  It follows that the side length of the triangle is $2 \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3} = 2 \\sqrt{6}$, so the area of the triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\cdot (2 \\sqrt{6})^2 = 6 \\sqrt{3},$ and the square of the area is $(6 \\sqrt{3})^2 = \\boxed{108}.$"
