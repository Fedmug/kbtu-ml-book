    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We'll use this helpful result a few times: for any real numbers $a$ and $b$, the graph of \\[|x-a|+|y-b|=1\\]is a \"diamond\": a square of side length $\\sqrt{2}$ centered at $(a, b)$ whose sides form angles of $45^\\circ$ with the axes. (To see this, first draw the graph of $|x| + |y| = 1$. Then, the graph of $|x-a|+|y-b|=1$ is just the result of translating in the $x$-direction by $a$, and then in the $y$-direction by $b$.)\n\nSince the given equation only involves $|x|$ and $|y|$, it is symmetric about the two axes. That is, it is sufficient to consider only the first quadrant, and then multiply our answer by $4$ to account for all four quadrants. So, assume $x, y \\ge 0$.Then the equation becomes \\[\\Big|\\big| x-2\\big|-1\\Big|+\\Big|\\big| y-2\\big|-1\\Big|=1.\\]Seeing $|x-2|$ and $|y-2|$, we take cases on the values of $x$ and $y$ relative to $2$:\n\nIf $0 \\le x, y \\le 2$, then the given equation becomes \\[\\Big|(2-x)-1\\Big|+\\Big|(2-y)-1\\Big|=1 \\implies |1-x| + |1-y| = 1.\\]This is the equation of the standard diamond centered at $(1, 1)$, which is completely contained in the region $0 \\le x, y \\le 2$.\nIf $0 \\le x \\le 2 \\le y$, then the given equation becomes \\[\\Big|(2-x)-1\\Big|+\\Big|(y-2)-1\\Big|=1 \\implies |1-x| + |y-3| = 1.\\]This is the equation of the standard diamond centered at $(1, 3)$, which is again contained in the correct region.\nIf $0 \\le y \\le 2 \\le x$, then we get the standard diamond centered at $(3,1)$, as in the last case.\nIf $2 \\le x, y$, then the given equation becomes \\[\\Big|(x-2)-1\\Big|+\\Big|(y-2)-1\\Big|=1 \\implies |x-3| + |y-3| = 1.\\]This is the equation of the standard diamond centered at $(3, 3)$, which is again contained in the region $2 \\le x, y$.\n\nThus, the graph of the given equation in the first quadrant consists of four standard diamonds, so the graph of the given equation in the whole plane consists of $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$ standard diamonds. These diamonds do not overlap, and each one has perimeter $4\\sqrt{2}$. So, the overall length of the lines that make up the graph is $16 \\cdot 4\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{64\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nBelow is the whole graph of the equation (tick marks are at $x, y = \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\ldots$).\n[asy]\nsize(8cm);\nvoid sq(real a, real b)\n{ draw((a+1,b)--(a,b+1)--(a-1,b)--(a,b-1)--cycle,blue); }\nfor (int a=-3; a<=3; a+=2)\nfor (int b=-3; b<=3; b+=2)\nsq(a,b);\ndraw((-5,0)--(5,0),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,5),EndArrow);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(5,0),NNW);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,5),ESE);\nfor (int i=-4; i<=4; ++i) {draw((i,-0.15)--(i,0.15)^^(-0.15,i)--(0.15,i));}\n[/asy]"
