    "problem": "A triangle is formed with one vertex at the vertex of the parabola $y=x^2-1$ and the other two vertices at the intersections of the line $y=r$ and the parabola. If the area of the triangle is between $8$ and $64$ inclusive, find all possible values of $r$. Express your answer in interval notation.",

    "solution": "The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is $\\frac{-b}{2a}=\\frac{0}{2(1)}=0$. The vertex is then $(0,-1)$. The intersections of the line $y=r$ with $y=x^2-1$ are found by setting the $y$ values equal to each other, so \\begin{align*}\nr&=x^2-1 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad r+1&=x^2 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad \\pm\\sqrt{r+1}&=x.\n\\end{align*}So the vertices of our triangle are $(0,-1)$, $(-\\sqrt{r+1},r)$, and $(\\sqrt{r+1},r)$. If we take the horizontal segment along the line $y=r$ to be the base of the triangle, we can find its length as the difference between the $x$-coordinates, which is $\\sqrt{r+1}-(-\\sqrt{r+1})=2\\sqrt{r+1}$. The height of the triangle is the distance from $(0,-1)$ to the line $y=r$, or $r+1$. So the area of the triangle is\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2}bh=\\frac{1}{2}(2\\sqrt{r+1})(r+1)=(r+1)\\sqrt{r+1}.\\]This can be expressed as $(r+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\n\nWe have $8\\le A\\le 64$, so $8\\le (r+1)^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\le 64$. Taking the cube root of all three sides gives $2\\le (r+1)^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\le 4$, and squaring gives $4\\le r+1\\le 16$. Finally, subtract $1$ to find $3\\le r\\le 15$. In interval notation, this is $\\boxed{[3,15]}$."
