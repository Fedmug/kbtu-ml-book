    "solution": "We recognize the number $\\sqrt[3]{7} + \\sqrt[3]{49}$ from the difference-of-cubes factorization \\[7 - 1 = \\left(\\sqrt[3]{7} - 1\\right)\\left(1 + \\sqrt[3]{7} + \\sqrt[3]{49}\\right).\\]Solving for $\\sqrt[3]{7} + \\sqrt[3]{49},$ we get \\[\\sqrt[3]{7} + \\sqrt[3]{49} = \\frac{7-1}{\\sqrt[3]{7}-1} - 1 = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt[3]{7}-1} - 1.\\]We can use this expression to build a polynomial which has $\\sqrt[3]{7} + \\sqrt[3]{49}$ as a root. First, note that $\\sqrt[3]{7}$ is a root of $x^3 - 7 = 0.$ Then, $\\sqrt[3]{7}-1$ is a root of $(x+1)^3 - 7 = 0,$ because $(\\sqrt[3]{7}-1+1)^3 - 7 = (\\sqrt[3]{7})^3 - 7 = 0.$ (You could also note that the graph of $y=(x+1)^3-7$ is a one-unit leftward shift of the graph of $y=x^3-7,$ so the roots of $(x+1)^3-7=0$ are one less than the roots of $x^3-7=0.$)\n\nIt follows that $\\frac{6}{\\sqrt[3]{7}-1}$ is a root of the equation \\[\\left(\\frac{6}{x}+1\\right)^3 - 7= 0,\\]because when $x = \\frac{6}{\\sqrt[3]{7}-1},$ we have $\\frac{6}{x} = \\sqrt[3]{7}-1.$ We multiply both sides by $x^3$ to create the polynomial equation \\[(6+x)^3 - 7x^3 = 0.\\]Finally, replacing $x$ with $x+1$ like before, we see that $\\frac{6}{\\sqrt[3]{7}-1} - 1$ is a root of the equation \\[(7+x)^3 - 7(x+1)^3 = 0.\\]This equation is equivalent to \\[x^3 - 21x - 56 = 0,\\]so by Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is $\\boxed{56}.$"
