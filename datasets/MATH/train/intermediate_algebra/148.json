    "problem": "Integers $x$ and $y$ with $x>y>0$ satisfy $x+y+xy=80$. What is $x$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we add 1 to both sides to get $xy + x + y + 1 = 81,$ so\n\\[(x + 1)(y + 1) = 81.\\]The only possibility is then $x + 1 = 27$ and $y + 1 = 3,$ so $x = \\boxed{26}.$"
