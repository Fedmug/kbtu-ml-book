    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We have that\n\\begin{align*}\nu_2 &= -\\frac{1}{a + 1}, \\\\\nu_3 &= -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{a + 1} + 1} = -\\frac{a + 1}{a}, \\\\\nu_4 &= -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{a + 1}{a} + 1} = a.\n\\end{align*}Since $u_4 = u_1,$ and each term depends only on the previous term, the sequence becomes periodic, with a period of length 3.  Hence, $u_{16} = u_1 = \\boxed{a}.$"
