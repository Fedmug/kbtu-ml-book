In order for the expression to be a perfect square, $(n+1)(7n+1)$ must be a perfect square.\nBy using the Euclidean Algorithm, $\\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = \\gcd(n+1,6)$. Thus, the GCD of $n+1$ and $7n+1$ must be factors of 6. Now, split the factors as different casework. Note that the quadratic residues of 7 are 0, 1, 2, and 4.\nIf $\\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = 6$, then $n \\equiv 5 \\pmod{6}$. Let $n = 6a+5$, so $(n+1)(7n+1) = (6a+6)(42a+36) = 36(a+1)(7a+6)$. Since 6 is divided out of $n+1$ and $7n+1$, $a+1$ and $7a+6$ are relatively prime, so $a+1$ and $7a+6$ must be perfect squares. However, since 6 is not a quadratic residue of 7, the GCD of $n+1$ and $7n+1$ can not be 6.\nIf $\\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = 3$, then $n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. Let $n = 3a+2$, so $(n+1)(7n+1) = (3a+3)(21a+15) = 9(a+1)(7a+5)$. Since 3 is divided out of $n+1$ and $7n+1$, $a+1$ and $7a+5$ are relatively prime, so $a+1$ and $7a+5$ must be perfect squares. However, since 5 is not a quadratic residue of 7, the GCD of $n+1$ and $7n+1$ can not be 3.\nIf $\\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = 2$, then $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$. Let $n = 2a+1$, so $(n+1)(7n+1) = (2a+2)(14a+8) = 4(a+1)(7a+4)$. Since 2 is divided out of $n+1$ and $7n+1$, $a+1$ and $7a+4$ are relatively prime, so $a+1$ and $7a+4$ must be perfect squares. We also know that $n+1$ and $7n+1$ do not share a factor of 3, so $n \\equiv 1,3 \\pmod{6}$. That means $n \\le 2007$, so $a \\le 1003$. After trying values of $a$ that are one less than a perfect square, we find that the largest value that makes $(n+1)(7n+1)$ a perfect square is $a = 960$. That means $n = 1921$.\nIf $\\gcd(n+1,7n+1) = 1$, then $n+1 \\equiv 1,5 \\pmod{6}$ (to avoid common factors that are factors of 6), so $n \\equiv 0,4 \\pmod{6}$. After trying values of $n$ that are one less than a perfect square, we find that the largest value that makes $(n+1)(7n+1)$ a perfect square is $n = 120$ (we could also stop searching once $n$ gets below 1921).\nFrom the casework, the largest natural number $n$ that makes $(1^2+2^2+3^2+\\cdots + n^2)\\left[(n+1)^2+(n+2)^2+(n+3)^2+\\cdots + (2n)^2\\right]$ is a perfect square is $\\boxed{1921}$."
