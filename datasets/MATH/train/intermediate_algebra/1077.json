    "problem": "A circle with center $C$ is tangent to the positive $x$ and $y$-axes and externally tangent to the circle centered at $(3,0)$ with radius $1$. What is the sum of all possible radii of the circle with center $C$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $r$ be the radius of such a circle.  Since the circle is tangent to the positive $x$-axis and positive $y$-axis, its center is $(r,r).$  This circle is also tangent to the circle centered at $(3,0)$ with radius 1, so\n\\[(r - 3)^2 + r^2 = (r + 1)^2.\\]This simplifies to $r^2 - 8r + 8 = 0.$  By the quadratic formula, the roots are $r = 4 \\pm 2 \\sqrt{2}.$  Thus, the sum of all possible values of $r$ is $\\boxed{8}.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair[] O;\nreal[] r;\n\nr[1] = 4 - 2*sqrt(2);\nO[1] = (r[1],r[1]);\nr[2] = 4 + 2*sqrt(2);\nO[2] = (r[2],r[2]);\n\ndraw(Circle(O[1],r[1]));\ndraw(arc(O[2],r[2],160,290));\ndraw(Circle((3,0),1));\ndraw((-0.5,0)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(0,9));\ndraw(O[1]--(r[1],0));\ndraw(O[1]--(0,r[1]));\ndraw(O[1]--(3,0));\ndraw(O[2]--(r[2],0));\ndraw(O[2]--(0,r[2]));\ndraw(O[2]--(3,0));\n\ndot(\"$(3,0)$\", (3,0), S);\ndot(\"$O_1$\", O[1], N);\ndot(\"$O_2$\", O[2], NE);\n[/asy]"
