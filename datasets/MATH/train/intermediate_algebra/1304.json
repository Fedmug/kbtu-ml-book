    "problem": "Solve the inequality\n\\[\\frac{8x^2 + 16x - 51}{(2x - 3)(x + 4)} < 3.\\]",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get\n\\[\\frac{8x^2 + 16x - 51 - 3(2x - 3)(x + 4)}{(2x - 3)(x + 4)} < 0.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{2x^2 + x - 15}{(2x - 3)(x + 4)} < 0,\\]or\n\\[\\frac{(x + 3)(2x - 5)}{(x + 4)(2x - 3)} < 0.\\]We can build a sign chart, but since all of the factors are linear, we can track what happens to the expression as $x$ increases.  At $x = -5,$ the expression is positive.  As $x$ increases past $-4,$ the expression becomes negative.  As $x$ increases past $-3,$ the expression becomes positive, and so on.  Thus, the solution is\n\\[x \\in \\boxed{(-4,-3) \\cup \\left( \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{5}{2} \\right)}.\\]"
