    "problem": "Find all roots of the polynomial $x^3+x^2-4x-4$. Enter your answer as a list of numbers separated by commas.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By the Rational Root Theorem, any root of the polynomial must divide $4$. Therefore the roots are among the numbers $\\pm 1,2$. Since these are only four values, we can try all of them to find that that the roots are $\\boxed{-1,2,-2}$."
