    "problem": "A sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots$ is chosen so that $a_n = a_{n - 1} - a_{n - 2}$ for each $n \\ge 3.$ What is the sum of the first $2001$ terms of this sequence if the sum of the first $1492$ terms is $1985,$ and the sum of the first $1985$ terms is $1492$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Letting $a_1 = x$ and $a_2 = y,$ we have \\[\\begin{aligned} a_3 &= y-x, \\\\ a_4 &= (y-x) - y = -x, \\\\ a_5 &= -x-(y-x) = -y, \\\\ a_6 &= -y-(-x) = x-y, \\\\ a_7 &= (x-y)-(-y) = x, \\\\ a_8 &= x-(x-y) = y. \\end{aligned}\\]Since $a_7 = a_1$ and $a_8 = a_2,$ the sequence repeats with period $6$; that is, $a_{k+6} = a_k$ for all positive integers $k.$\n\nFurthermore, the sum of any six consecutive terms in the sequence equals \\[x + y + (y-x) + (-x) + (-y) + (x-y) = 0.\\]So, since $1492$ is $4$ more than a multiple of six, the sum of the first $1492$ terms is equal to the sum of the first four terms: \\[\\begin{aligned} 1985 &= a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_{1492} \\\\&= a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4\\\\&=x+y+(y-x)+(-x)\\\\&=2y-x. \\end{aligned}\\]Similarly, since $1985$ is $5$ more than a multiple of six, we have \\[\\begin{aligned}1492 &= a_1+a_2+\\dots+a_{1985}\\\\&=a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5\\\\&=x+y+(y-x)+(-x)+(-y)\\\\&=y-x. \\end{aligned}\\]Subtracting this second equation from the first equation, we get $y = 1985 - 1492 = 493.$\n\nSince $2001$ is $3$ more than a multiple of six, we have \\[\\begin{aligned}a_1+a_2+\\dots+a_{2001} &= a_1+a_2+a_3\\\\&=x+y+(y-x)\\\\&=2y = 2\\cdot 493 = \\boxed{986}.\\end{aligned}\\](Note that solving for $x$ was not strictly necessary.)"
