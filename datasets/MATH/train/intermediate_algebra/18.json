    "problem": "When a polynomial is divided by $2x^2 - 7x + 18,$ what are the possible degrees of the remainder?  Enter all the possible values, separated by commas.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "In general, when a polynomial is divided by a polynomial of degree $d,$ then the possible degrees of the remainder are 0, 1, 2, $\\dots,$ $d - 1.$  Therefore, the possible degrees of the remainder here are $\\boxed{0,1}.$"
