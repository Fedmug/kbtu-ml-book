    "problem": "On the first day, Barry Sotter used his magic wand to make an object's length increase by $\\frac{1}{2}$, meaning that if the length of the object was originally $x,$ then it is now $x + \\frac{1}{2} x.$  On the second day he increased the object's longer length by $\\frac{1}{3}$; on the third day he increased the object's new length by $\\frac{1}{4}$; and so on. On the $n^{\\text{th}}$ day of performing this trick, Barry will make the object's length exactly 100 times its original length. What is the value of $n$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "On day $n$, Barry increases the length of the object by a factor of $\\frac{n+2}{n+1}$.  Thus, the overall increase through day $n$ is by a factor of $\\left( \\frac32 \\right) \\left( \\frac43\\right) \\cdots \\left( \\frac{n+1}{n}\\right) \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+1}\\right)$.  Canceling, we see that this expression equals $\\frac{n+2}2$.  Thus we have $\\frac{n+2}2=100$, and so $n=\\boxed{198}.$"
