    "problem": "Solve the inequality\n\\[\\frac{(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)}{(x - 1)(x - 5)(x - 6)} > 0.\\]",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We can build a sign chart, but since all of the factors are linear, we can track what happens to the expression as $x$ increases.  At $x = 0,$ the expression is positive.  As $x$ increases past 1, the expression becomes negative.  As $x$ increases past 2, the expression becomes positive, and so on.  Thus, the solution is\n\\[x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,1) \\cup (2,3) \\cup (4,5) \\cup (6,\\infty)}.\\]"
