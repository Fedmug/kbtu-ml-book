    "problem": "Which type of conic section is described by the equation \\[(x+5)^2 = (4y-3)^2 - 140?\\]Enter \"C\" for circle, \"P\" for parabola, \"E\" for ellipse, \"H\" for hyperbola, and \"N\" for none of the above.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "If we were to expand the given equation and move all the terms to the left-hand side, we would have a $x^2$ term and a $-16y^2$ term. Because the coefficients of the $x^2$ and $y^2$ terms have opposite signs, this conic section must be a $\\boxed{(\\text{H})}$ hyperbola."
