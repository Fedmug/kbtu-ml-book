    "solution": "Setting $a = 0$ and $b = 0$ in the given functional equation, we get\n\\[2f(0) = 2f[(0)]^2.\\]Hence, $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1.$\n\nSetting $a = 0$ and $b = 1$ in the given functional equation, we get\n\\[2f(1) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(1)]^2.\\]If $f(0) = 0,$ then $2f(1) = [f(1)]^2,$ which means $f(1) = 0$ or $f(1) = 2.$  If $f(0) = 1,$ then $[f(1)]^2 - 2f(1) + 1 = [f(1) - 1]^2 = 0,$ so $f(1) = 1.$\n\nWe divide into cases accordingly, but before we do so, note that we can get to $f(25)$ with the following values:\n\\begin{align*}\na = 1, b = 1: \\ & 2f(2) = 2[f(1)]^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad f(2) = [f(1)]^2 \\\\\na = 1, b = 2: \\ & 2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 \\\\\na = 0, b = 5: \\ & 2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2\n\\end{align*}Case 1: $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 0.$\n\nFrom the equations above, $f(2) = [f(1)]^2 = 0,$ $2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 = 0$ so $f(5) = 0,$ and $2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2 = 0,$ so $f(25) = 0.$\n\nNote that the function $f(n) = 0$ satisfies the given functional equation, which shows that $f(25)$ can take on the value of 0.\n\nCase 2: $f(0) = 0$ and $f(1) = 2.$\n\nFrom the equations above, $f(2) = [f(1)]^2 = 4,$ $2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 = 20$ so $f(5) = 10,$ and $2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2 = 100,$ so $f(25) = 50.$\n\nNote that the function $f(n) = 2n$ satisfies the given functional equation, which shows that $f(25)$ can take on the value of 50.\n\nCase 3: $f(0) = 1$ and $f(1) = 1.$\n\nFrom the equations above, $f(2) = [f(1)]^2 = 1,$ $2f(5) = [f(1)]^2 + [f(2)]^2 = 2$ so $f(5) = 1,$ and $2f(25) = [f(0)]^2 + [f(5)]^2 = 2,$ so $f(25) = 1.$\n\nNote that the function $f(n) = 1$ satisfies the given functional equation, which shows that $f(25)$ can take on the value of 1.\n\nHence, there are $n = 3$ different possible values of $f(25),$ and their sum is $s = 0 + 50 + 1 = 51,$ which gives a final answer of $n \\times s = 3 \\times 51 = \\boxed{153}$."
