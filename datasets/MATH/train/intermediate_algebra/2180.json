    "solution": "Solution #1\n\nSince $p(x)$ has real coefficients and has $3-2i$ as a root, it also has the complex conjugate, $3+2i$, as a root. The quadratic that has $3-2i$ and $3+2i$ as roots is\n\\begin{align*}\n\\left(x-(3-2i)\\right)\\left(x-(3+2i)\\right) &= (x-3+2i)(x-3-2i) \\\\\n&= (x-3)^2 - (2i)^2 \\\\\n&= x^2-6x+9+4 \\\\\n&= x^2-6x+13.\n\\end{align*}By the Factor Theorem, we know that $x^2-6x+13$ divides $p(x)$. Since $p(x)$ is cubic, it has one more root $r$. We can now write $p(x)$ in the form\n$$p(x) = a(x^2-6x+13)(x-r).$$Moreover, $a=1$, because we are given that $p(x)$ is monic.\n\nSubstituting $x=0$, we have $p(0)=-13r$, but we also know that $p(0)=-52$; therefore, $r=4$. Hence we have\n\\begin{align*}\np(x) &= (x^2-6x+13)(x-4) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{x^3-10x^2+37x-52}.\n\\end{align*}Solution #2 (essentially the same as #1, but written in terms of using Vieta's formulas)\n\nSince $p(x)$ has real coefficients and has $3-2i$ as a root, it also has the complex conjugate, $3+2i$, as a root. The sum and product of these two roots, respectively, are $6$ and $3^2-(2i)^2=13$. Thus, the monic quadratic that has these two roots is $x^2-6x+13$.\n\nBy the Factor Theorem, we know that $x^2-6x+13$ divides $p(x)$. Since $p(x)$ is cubic, it has one more root $r$. Because $p(0)$ equals the constant term, and because $p(x)$ is monic, Vieta's formulas tell us that $(3-2i)(3+2i)r = (-1)^3(-52) = 52$. Thus $r=4$, and\n\\begin{align*}\np(x) &= (x^2-6x+13)(x-4) \\\\\n&= \\boxed{x^3-10x^2+37x-52}.\n\\end{align*}"
