    "solution": "We want to square the equation in order to eliminate the radicals. To do so, we first move the $\\sqrt{x+\\frac4x}$ term to the right-hand side, giving \\[\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{x}} = 6 - \\sqrt{x+\\frac{4}{x}}.\\]Now we see that squaring will produce lots of common terms on the left-hand and right-hand sides, which cancel: \\[\\begin{aligned}  \\\\ \\left(\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{x}}\\right)^2 &= \\left(6 - \\sqrt{x+\\frac{4}{x}}\\right)^2 \\\\ x + 4 + \\frac 4x &= 36 - 12 \\sqrt{x + \\frac{4}{x}} + \\left(x + \\frac{4}{x}\\right) \\end{aligned}\\]which simplifies to $3\\sqrt{x+\\frac{4}{x}} = 8.$ Squaring both sides, multiplying, and rearranging gives the quadratic \\[9x^2 - 64x + 36 = 0.\\]By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this quadratic is $\\boxed{\\frac{64}{9}}.$\n\nTo be complete, we must check that both of these roots satisfy the original equation. There are two steps in our above solution which could potentially not be reversible: squaring the equation \\[\\sqrt x + \\sqrt{\\frac 4x} = 6 - \\sqrt{x+\\frac 4x},\\]and squaring the equation \\[3\\sqrt{x+\\frac 4x} = 8.\\]To check that these steps are reversible, we need to make sure that both sides of the equations in both steps are nonnegative whenever $x$ is a root of $9x^2-64x+36=0.$ This quadratic is equivalent to $x+\\frac4x=\\frac{64}{9},$ so $6-\\sqrt{x+\\frac4x}=6-\\sqrt{\\frac{64}{9}}=\\frac{10}{3},$ which is positive, and $3\\sqrt{x+\\frac{4}{x}} = 3\\sqrt{\\frac{64}{9}} = 8,$ which is also positive. Therefore, all our steps were reversible, so both roots of the quadratic satisfy the original equation as well."
