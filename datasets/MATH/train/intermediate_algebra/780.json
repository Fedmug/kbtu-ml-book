    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By the Integer Root Theorem, the possible integer roots are all the divisors of 15 (including negative divisors), which are $-15,$ $-5,$ $-3,$ $-1,$ $1,$ $3,$ $5,$ and $15.$  Checking, we find that the only integer roots are $\\boxed{-3,1,5}.$"
