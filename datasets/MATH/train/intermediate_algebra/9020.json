    "solution": "First, observe that the difference between consecutive terms within a grouping will always equal $3.$ Second, since all terms in a group with $n$ terms are congruent to $n$ modulo $3$ and all terms in a group with $n+1$ terms are congruent to $n+1$ modulo $3,$ the difference between the first term of the group with $n+1$ terms and the last term of the group with $n$ terms is $1.$ This means that the difference between the last terms of a grouping $(1,5,12,22 \\cdots)$ have the same second difference, so the series of numbers can be modeled by a quadratic function.\nLet $n$ be the number of terms in a group, and let $f(n)$ be the last term in a group with $n$ terms. We can write a system of equations to find a quadratic function.\\begin{align*} a+b+c &= 1 \\\\ 4a+2b+c &= 5 \\\\ 9a+3b+c &= 12 \\end{align*}Solving the system yields $a=\\tfrac32, b=-\\tfrac12, c=0,$ making the function $f(n) = \\tfrac32 x^2 - \\tfrac12 x = \\tfrac{x(3x-1)}{2}.$\nNote that the last term of the group with $n$ terms is term $\\tfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$ in the sequence. The largest $n$ such that $\\tfrac{n(n+1)}{2} \\le 2008$ is $62,$ and $f(62) = \\tfrac{62 \\cdot 185}{2} = 5735.$ Since $\\tfrac{62 \\cdot 63}{2} = 1953,$ the $1953^\\text{th}$ term of the sequence is $5735.$ This means the $1954^\\text{th}$ term is $5736,$ and with some basic algebra (or skip counting), the $2008^\\text{th}$ term is $\\boxed{5898}.$"
