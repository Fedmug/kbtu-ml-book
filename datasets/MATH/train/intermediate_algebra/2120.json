    "solution": "Then the equation of the tangent at $A = (1,1)$ is of the form\n\\[y - 1 = m(x - 1),\\]or $y = mx - m + 1.$  Substituting into $y = x^2,$ we get\n\\[mx - m + 1 = x^2.\\]Then $x^2 - mx + m - 1 = 0.$  Since we have a tangent, this quadratic should have a double root.  And since the $x$-coordinate of $A$ is $1,$ the double root is $x = 1.$  Hence, this quadratic is identical to $(x - 1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1,$ which means $m = 2.$\n\nThen the slope of the normal is $-\\frac{1}{2},$ so the equation of the normal is\n\\[y - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2} (x - 1).\\]We want the intersection of the normal with $y = x^2,$ so we set $y = x^2$:\n\\[x^2 - 1 = -\\frac{1}{2} (x - 1).\\]We can factor the left-hand side:\n\\[(x - 1)(x + 1) = -\\frac{1}{2} (x - 1).\\]The solution $x = 1$ corresponds to the point $A.$  Otherwise, $x \\neq 1,$ so we can divide both sides by $x - 1$:\n\\[x + 1 = -\\frac{1}{2}.\\]Hence, $x = -\\frac{3}{2},$ so $B = \\boxed{\\left( -\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{9}{4} \\right)}.$"
