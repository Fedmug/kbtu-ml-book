    "problem": "Let $F_1 = (0,1)$ and $F_ 2= (4,1).$  Then the set of points $P$ such that\n\\[PF_1 + PF_2 = 6\\]form an ellipse.  The equation of this ellipse can be written as\n\\[\\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} + \\frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.\\]Find $h + k + a + b.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We have that $2a = 6,$ so $a = 3.$  The distance between the foci is $2c = 4,$ so $c = 2.$  Hence, $b = \\sqrt{a^2 - c^2} = \\sqrt{5}.$\n\nThe center of the ellipse is the midpoint of $\\overline{F_1 F_2},$ which is $(2,1).$  Thus, the equation of the ellipse is\n\\[\\frac{(x - 2)^2}{3^2} + \\frac{(y - 1)^2}{(\\sqrt{5})^2} = 1.\\]Hence, $h + k + a + b = 2 + 1 + 3 + \\sqrt{5} = \\boxed{6 + \\sqrt{5}}.$"
