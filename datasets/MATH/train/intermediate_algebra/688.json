For example, $\\{-2, -2, 5, 5, 5\\}$ and $\\{5, -2, 5, 5, -2\\}$ are the same multiset, but both are different from $\\{-2, 5, 5, 5\\}.$  And as usual, $a_{10} \\neq 0$ and $a_0 \\neq 0.$)",

    "solution": "Let $r$ be an integer root of the first polynomial $p(x) = a_{10} x^{10} + a_9 x^9 + a_8 x^8 + \\dots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0,$ so\n\\[a_{10} r^{10} + a_9 r^9 + \\dots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0.\\]Since $a_0$ is not equal to 0, $r$ cannot be equal to 0.  Hence, we can divide both sides by $r^{10},$ to get\n\\[a_{10} + a_9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{r} + \\dots + a_1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{r^9} + a_0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{r^{10}} = 0.\\]Thus, $\\frac{1}{r}$ is a root of the second polynomial $q(x) = a_0 x^{10} + a_1 x^9 + a_2 x^8 + \\dots + a_8 x^2 + a_9 x + a_{10} = 0.$  This means that $\\frac{1}{r}$ must also be an integer.\n\nThe only integers $r$ for which $\\frac{1}{r}$ is also an integer are $r = 1$ and $r = -1.$  Furthermore, $r = \\frac{1}{r}$ for these values, so if the only roots of $p(x)$ are 1 and $-1,$ then the multiset of roots of $q(x)$ are automatically the same as the multiset of roots of $p(x).$  Therefore, the possible multisets are the ones that contain $k$ values of 1 and $10 - k$ values of $-1,$ for $0 \\le k \\le 10.$  There are 11 possible values of $k,$ so there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible multisets."
