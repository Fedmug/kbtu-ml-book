    "problem": "Let $k$ and $m$ be real numbers, and suppose that the roots of the equation \\[x^3 - 7x^2 + kx - m = 0\\]are three distinct positive integers. Compute $k + m.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the equation is $7.$ Furthermore, the only triple of distinct positive integers with a sum of $7$ is $\\{1, 2, 4\\}.$ To see this, note that the largest possible value for any of the three integers is $7 - 1 - 2 = 4,$ and the only way to choose three of the integers $1, 2, 3, 4$ to sum to $7$ is to choose $1,$ $2,$ and $4.$\n\nTherefore, the roots of the equation must be $1,$ $2,$ and $4.$ It follows by Vieta that \\[k = 1 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 4 + 1 \\cdot 4 = 14\\]and \\[m = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 4 = 8,\\]so $k+m = 14+8 = \\boxed{22}.$"
