    "problem": "A famous theorem states that given any five points in the plane, with no three on the same line, there is a unique conic section (ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola) which passes through all five points. The conic section passing through the five points \\[(-\\tfrac32, 1), \\; (0,0), \\;(0,2),\\; (3,0),\\; (3,2).\\]is an ellipse whose axes are parallel to the coordinate axes. Find the length of its minor axis.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The four points $(0,0),$ $(0,2),$ $(3,0),$ and $(3,2)$ form a rectangle, and the horizontal line through $(-\\tfrac32, 1)$ bisects the rectangle. So, visually, we hope that the center of the ellipse coincides with the center of the rectangle, which has coordinates $\\left(\\tfrac32, 1\\right),$ and that its major axis should pass through the point $(-\\tfrac32, 1).$\n\nIn this case, the semimajor axis has length $\\tfrac32 - (-\\tfrac32) = 3.$ Then, its equation must take the form \\[\\frac{(x-\\tfrac32)^2}{3^2} + \\frac{(y-1)^2}{b^2} = 1\\]where $b$ is the length of the semiminor axis. Since $(0,0)$ lies on the ellipse, setting $x=y=0,$ we have \\[\\frac{\\left(\\frac32\\right)^2}{3^2} + \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1,\\]or $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{b^2} = 1.$ Solving for $b$ gives $b = \\frac{2\\sqrt3}{3},$ so the length of the minor axis is $2b = \\boxed{\\frac{4\\sqrt3}{3}}.$"
