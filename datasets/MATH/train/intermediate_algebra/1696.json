    "problem": "Suppose $z$ is a complex number such that $z^2 = 24-32i$.  Find $|z|$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $z^2 = 24-32i$, we must have $|z^2| = |24-32i| = |8(3-4i)| = 8|3-4i| = 8(5) = 40$.  We also have $|z|^2 = |z|\\cdot |z| = |(z)(z)| = |z^2|$, so $|z^2| = 40$ means that $|z|^2 = 40$, which gives us $|z| = \\sqrt{40} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{10}}$."
