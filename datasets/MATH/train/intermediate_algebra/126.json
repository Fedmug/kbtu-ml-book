    "problem": "Find the distance between the foci of the hyperbola\n\\[\\frac{y^2}{18} - \\frac{x^2}{2} = 1.\\]",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We have that $a^2 = 18$ and $b^2 = 2,$ so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 20,$ and $c = \\sqrt{20} = 2 \\sqrt{5}.$  Therefore, the distance between the foci is $2c = \\boxed{4 \\sqrt{5}}.$"
