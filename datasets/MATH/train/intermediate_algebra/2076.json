    "solution": "Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix.  Completing the square on $x,$ we get\n\\[y = -2(x - 1)^2 - 6.\\]To make the algebra a bit easier, we can find the directrix of the parabola $y = -2x^2,$ shift the parabola right by 1 unit to get $y = -2(x - 1)^2$ (which does not change the directrix), and then shift it downward 6 units to find the directrix of the parabola $y = -2(x - 1)^2 - 6.$\n\nSince the parabola $y = -2x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\npair F, P, Q;\n\nF = (0,-1/4);\nP = (1,-1);\nQ = (1,1/4);\n\nreal parab (real x) {\n  return(-x^2);\n}\n\ndraw(graph(parab,-1.5,1.5),red);\ndraw((-1.5,1/4)--(1.5,1/4),dashed);\ndraw(P--F);\ndraw(P--Q);\n\ndot(\"$F$\", F, SW);\ndot(\"$P$\", P, E);\ndot(\"$Q$\", Q, N);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $(x,-2x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = -2x^2.$  Then\n\\[PF^2 = x^2 + (-2x^2 - f)^2\\]and $PQ^2 = (-2x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus,\n\\[x^2 + (-2x^2 - f)^2 = (-2x^2 - d)^2.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[x^2 + 4x^4 + 4fx^2 + f^2 = 4x^4 + 4dx^2 + d^2.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + 4f &= 4d, \\\\\nf^2 &= d^2.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $d - f = \\frac{1}{4}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $2d = \\frac{1}{4},$ so $d = \\frac{1}{8}.$\n\nThus, the equation of the directrix of $y = -2x^2$ is $y = \\frac{1}{8},$ so the equation of the directrix of $y = -2(x - 1)^2 - 6$ is $\\boxed{y = -\\frac{47}{8}}.$"
