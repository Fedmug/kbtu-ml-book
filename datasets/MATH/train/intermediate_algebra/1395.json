    "solution": "Recall that a parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus $F$ and the directrix.  Completing the square on $x,$ we get\n\\[y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3.\\]To make the algebra a bit easier, we can find the focus of the parabola $y = -3x^2,$ shift the parabola left by 1 unit to get $y = -3(x + 1)^2,$ and then shift it upward 3 units to find the focus of the parabola $y = -3(x + 1)^2 + 3.$\n\nSince the parabola $y = -3x^2$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the focus is at a point of the form $(0,f).$  Let $y = d$ be the equation of the directrix.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\npair F, P, Q;\n\nF = (0,-1/4);\nP = (1,-1);\nQ = (1,1/4);\n\nreal parab (real x) {\n  return(-x^2);\n}\n\ndraw(graph(parab,-1.5,1.5),red);\ndraw((-1.5,1/4)--(1.5,1/4),dashed);\ndraw(P--F);\ndraw(P--Q);\n\ndot(\"$F$\", F, SW);\ndot(\"$P$\", P, E);\ndot(\"$Q$\", Q, N);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $(x,-3x^2)$ be a point on the parabola $y = -3x^2.$  Then\n\\[PF^2 = x^2 + (-3x^2 - f)^2\\]and $PQ^2 = (-3x^2 - d)^2.$  Thus,\n\\[x^2 + (-3x^2 - f)^2 = (-3x^2 - d)^2.\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[x^2 + 9x^4 + 6fx^2 + f^2 = 9x^4 + 6dx^2 + d^2.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + 6f &= 6d, \\\\\nf^2 &= d^2.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $d - f = \\frac{1}{6}.$  Since $f^2 = d^2,$ $f = d$ or $f = -d.$  We cannot have $f = d,$ so $f = -d.$  Then $-2f = \\frac{1}{6},$ so $f = -\\frac{1}{12}.$\n\nThus, the focus of $y = -3x^2$ is $\\left( 0, -\\frac{1}{12} \\right),$ and the focus of $y = -3(x + 1)^2$ is $\\left( -1, -\\frac{1}{12} \\right),$ so the focus of $y = -3(x - 1)^2 + 3$ is $\\boxed{\\left( -1, \\frac{35}{12} \\right)}.$"
