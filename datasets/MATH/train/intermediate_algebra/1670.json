    "problem": "Let $f(n)$ be the base-10 logarithm of the sum of the elements of the $n$th row in Pascal's triangle. Express $\\frac{f(n)}{\\log_{10} 2}$ in terms of $n$. Recall that Pascal's triangle begins\n\n\\begin{tabular}{rccccccccc}\n$n=0$:& & & & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n$n=1$:& & & & 1 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n$n=2$:& & & 1 & & 2 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n$n=3$:& & 1 & & 3 & & 3 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n$n=4$:& 1 & & 4 & & 6 & & 4 & & 1\\\\\\noalign{\\smallskip\\smallskip}\n& & & & & $\\vdots$ & & & &\n\n\\end{tabular}",

    "solution": "Computing the sums of the entries in the first few rows suggestions that the sum of the entries in row $n$ is $2^n$. Indeed, one way to prove this formula is to note that the $k$th entry of the $n$th row is $\\binom{n}{k}$ (if we say that the entries in the $n$th row are numbered $k=0,1,\\dots,n$). We have  \\[\n\\binom{n}{0}+\\binom{n}{1}+\\binom{n}{2}+\\dots +\\binom{n}{n} = 2^n,\n\\]since both sides calculate the number of ways to choose some subset of $n$ objects. It follows that $f(n)=\\log_{10} (2^n)$, which means that $\\frac{f(n)}{\\log_{10} 2}=\\frac{\\log_{10} (2^n)}{\\log_{10} 2}$. Applying the change of base formula gives us $\\log_2 (2^n)=\\boxed{n}$."
