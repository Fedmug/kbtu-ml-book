    "problem": "What is the domain of the function $f(x)=\\log_2(\\log_3(\\log_4x))$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "In order for the given function to have a real value, $\\log_3(\\log_4x)>0$ (since the logarithm of only any positive number is real). In order for the last inequality to be true, $\\log_4x>1$ (since the logarithm of only any number greater than 1 is greater than 0). The last inequality is true only if $x>4^1$, so $x>4$, or $x \\in \\boxed{(4, \\infty)}$ in interval notation."
