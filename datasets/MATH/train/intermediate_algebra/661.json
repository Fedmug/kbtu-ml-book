    "problem": "Solve the equation \\[-x^2 = \\frac{3x+1}{x+3}.\\]Enter all solutions, separated by commas.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying both sides by $x+3,$ we have $-x^2(x+3) = 3x+1,$ or $-x^3 - 3x^2 = 3x + 1.$ Thus, \\[x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0.\\]We recognize the left-hand side as the expansion of $(x+1)^3,$ so \\[(x+1)^3 = 0.\\]This forces $x+1=0,$ so $x = \\boxed{-1},$ which is the only solution."
