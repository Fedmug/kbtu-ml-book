    "problem": "For some integer $m$, the polynomial $x^3 - 2011x + m$ has the three integer roots $a$, $b$, and $c$.  Find $|a| + |b| + |c|.$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "By Vieta's formulas, \\[\\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} a + b + c &= 0 \\\\ ab+bc+ac&=-2011. \\end{aligned} \\right.\\]Since $a+b=-c,$ the second equation becomes $ab+(-c)c = -2011$, or \\[c^2 - ab= 2011.\\]At least two of $a, b, c$ must have the same sign; without loss of generality, let $a$ and $b$ have the same sign. Furthermore, since we can negate all of $a, b, c$ and still satisfy the two above equations, assume that $c \\ge 0.$ (Note that we only want the sum $|a| + |b| + |c|$, which does not change if we swap or negate the variables.)\n\nNow, we have $ab \\ge 0,$ so $c^2 \\ge 2011$, giving $c \\ge 44.$ We also have \\[\\frac{c^2}{4} = \\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)^2 \\ge ab\\]by AM-GM, so $2011 = c^2 - ab \\ge 3c^2/4,$ giving $c \\le 51.$\n\nFinally, we have $(a-b)^2 = (a+b)^2 - 4ab = (-c)^2 - 4(c^2-2011) = 8044 - 3c^2$, which must be a perfect square.\n\nTesting $c = 44, 45, \\ldots, 51$, we find that $8044 - 3c^2$ is a perfect square only when $c = 49$. Therefore, $c = 49$, and so \\[\\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} a+b&= -c = -49, \\\\ ab &= c^2 - 2011 = 390. \\end{aligned} \\right.\\]Thus, $a$ and $b$ are the roots of $t^2 + 49t + 390 = 0$, which factors as $(t+10)(t+39) = 0$. Thus, $\\{a, b\\} = \\{-10, -39\\}$.\n\nThe answer is \\[|a| + |b| + |c| = 39 + 10 + 49 = \\boxed{98}.\\]"
