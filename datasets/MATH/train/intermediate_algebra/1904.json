    "problem": "Gracie and Joe are choosing numbers on the complex plane. Joe chooses the point $1+2i$. Gracie chooses $-1+i$. How far apart are Gracie and Joe's points?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "To find the distance between two complex numbers, we find the magnitude of their difference. We calculate $(1+2i)-(-1+i)$ to be $2+i$. Now, $|2+i|=\\sqrt{2^2+1^2}=\\sqrt{5}$, thus the distance between the points is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{5}}$."
