    "problem": "The vertices $V$ of a centrally symmetric hexagon in the complex plane are given by \\[V=\\left\\{   \\sqrt{2}i,-\\sqrt{2}i, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(1+i),\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(-1+i),\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(1-i),\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(-1-i) \\right\\}.\\]For each $j$, $1\\leq j\\leq 12$, an element $z_j$ is chosen from $V$ at random, independently of the other choices. Let $P={\\prod}_{j=1}^{12}z_j$ be the product of the $12$ numbers selected.\n\nThe probability that $P=-1$ can be expressed in the form\n\\[\\frac{a}{p^b},\\]where $a,$ $b,$ $p$ are positive integers, $p$ is prime, and $a$ is not divisible by $p.$  Find $a + b + p.$",

    "solution": "The first two vertices of $V$ have magnitude $\\sqrt{2}$, while the other four have magnitude $\\dfrac{1}{2}$. In order for $P=-1$, it must be the case that $|P|=1$, which only happens if there are two magnitude-$\\sqrt{2}$ vertices for each magnitude-$\\dfrac{1}{2}$ one. Define $P_1$ as the product of the magnitude-$\\sqrt{2}$ vertices chosen and $P_2$ as the product of the magnitude-$\\dfrac{1}{2}$ vertices chosen.\n\nThere are $\\dbinom{12}{8}$ ways to select which of the 12 draws come up with a magnitude-$\\sqrt{2}$ number. The arguments of those numbers are all $\\pm\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$, so $P_1$ has an argument that is a multiple of $\\pi$. Half of the $2^8$ draw sequences will produce a result with argument equivalent to $0$ and the other half will have an argument equivalent to $\\pi$.\n\nSimilarly, the arguments of the other four numbers are $\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}+k\\cdot\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$, so $P_2$ has argument $k\\cdot\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$ for some integer $k$. The $4^4$ ways to select four magnitude-$\\dfrac{1}{2}$ numbers are equally likely to produce any of the four possible product arguments.\n\nIn order for $P=-1$, the argument of the product must be $-\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$. That happens only if:\n(a) $P_1$ has argument $0$ and $P_2$ has argument $-\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$, which happens with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{4}=\\dfrac{1}{8}$.\n(b) $P_2$ has argument $\\pi$ and $P_2$ has argument $\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$, which also happens with probability $\\dfrac{1}{2}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{4}=\\dfrac{1}{8}$.\nPutting these cases together, we find that $\\dfrac{1}{8}+\\dfrac{1}{8}=\\dfrac{1}{4}$ of the $2^8\\cdot 4^4=2^{16}$ sequences of eight magnitude-$\\sqrt{2}$ and four magnitude-$\\dfrac{1}{2}$ vertices will have the correct argument for $P=-1$.\n\nThe probability that $P=-1$ is\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\dfrac{\\dbinom{12}{4}\\cdot\\dfrac{1}{4}\\cdot 2^{16}}{6^{12}} &= \\dfrac{\\dbinom{12}{4}4}{3^{12}} \\\\\n   &= \\dfrac{12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10\\cdot 9\\cdot 4}{4!\\cdot 3^{12}} \\\\\n   &= \\dfrac{220}{3^{10}}. \\\\\n\\end{align*}The final answer is $220 + 3 + 10 = \\boxed{233}.$"
