    "problem": "A circle rests in the interior of the parabola with equation $y = x^2,$ so that it is tangent to the parabola at two points.  How much higher is the center of the circle than the points of tangency?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let one of the points of tangency be $(a,a^2).$  By symmetry, other point of tangency is $(-a,a^2).$  Also by symmetry, the center of the circle lies on the $y$-axis.  Let the center be $(0,b),$ and let the radius be $r.$\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\nreal func (real x) {\n  return(x^2);\n}\n\npair A = (1,1), O = (0,3/2);\n\ndraw(Circle(O,sqrt(5)/2));\ndraw(graph(func,-1.5,1.5));\ndraw((-1.5,0)--(1.5,0));\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(0,3));\n\ndot(\"$(a,a^2)$\", A, SE);\ndot(\"$(-a,a^2)$\", (-1,1), SW);\ndot(\"$(0,b)$\", O, E);\n[/asy]\n\nThe equation of the parabola is $y = x^2.$  The equation of the circle is $x^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2.$  Substituting $y = x^2,$ we get\n\\[x^2 + (x^2 - b)^2 = r^2.\\]This expands as\n\\[x^4 + (1 - 2b)x^2 + b^2 - r^2 = 0.\\]Since $(a,a^2)$ and $(-a,a^2)$ are points of tangency, $x = a$ and $x = -a$ are double roots of this quartic.  In other words, it is the same as\n\\[(x - a)^2 (x + a)^2 = (x^2 - a^2)^2 = x^4 - 2a^2 x^2 + a^4 = 0.\\]Equating the coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1 - 2b &= -2a^2, \\\\\nb^2 - r^2 &= a^4.\n\\end{align*}Then $2b - 2a^2 = 1.$  Therefore, the difference between the $y$-coordinates of the center of the circle $(0,b)$ and the point of tangency $(a,a^2)$ is\n\\[b - a^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\]"
