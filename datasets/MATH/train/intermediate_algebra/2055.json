    "solution": "The function $f_{1}(x)=\\sqrt{1-x}$ is defined when $x\\leq1$. Next, we have \\[f_{2}(x)=f_{1}(\\sqrt{4-x})=\\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{4-x}}.\\]For this to be defined, we must have $4-x\\ge0$ or $x \\le 4,$ and the number $\\sqrt{4-x}$ must lie in the domain of $f_1,$ so $\\sqrt{4-x} \\le 1,$ or $x \\ge 3.$ Thus, the domain of $f_2$ is $[3, 4].$\n\nSimilarly, for $f_3(x) = f_2\\left(\\sqrt{9-x}\\right)$ to be defined, we must have $x \\le 9,$ and the number $\\sqrt{9-x}$ must lie in the interval $[3, 4].$ Therefore, \\[3 \\le \\sqrt{9-x} \\le 4.\\]Squaring all parts of this inequality chain gives $9 \\le 9-x \\le 16,$ and so $-7 \\le x \\le 0.$ Thus, the domain of $f_3$ is $[-7, 0].$\n\nSimilarly, for $f_4(x) = f_3\\left(\\sqrt{16-x}\\right)$ to be defined, we must have $x \\le 16,$ and $\\sqrt{16-x}$ must lie in the interval $[-7, 0].$ But $\\sqrt{16-x}$ is always nonnegative, so we must have $\\sqrt{16-x} = 0,$ or $x=16.$ Thus, the domain of $f_4$ consists of a single point $\\{16\\}.$\n\nWe see, then, that $f_5(x) = f_4\\left(\\sqrt{25-x}\\right)$ is defined if and only if $\\sqrt{25-x} = 16,$ or $x = 25 - 16^2 = -231.$ Therefore, the domain of $f_5$ is $\\{-231\\}.$\n\nThe domain of $f_6(x)$ is empty, because $\\sqrt{36-x}$ can never equal a negative number like $-231.$ Thus, $N = 5$ and $c = \\boxed{-231}.$"
