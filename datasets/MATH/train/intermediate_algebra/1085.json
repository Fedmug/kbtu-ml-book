    "solution": "A. The function $a(x) = \\sqrt{2 - x}$ is decreasing, so it has an inverse.\n\nB. Note that $b(0) = b(1) = 0,$ so the function $b(x)$ does not have an inverse.\n\nC. Note that $c \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = c(2) = \\frac{5}{2},$ so the function $c(x)$ does not have an inverse.\n\nD. The function $d(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 7 = 2(x + 1)^2 + 5$ is increasing on $[0,\\infty),$ so it has an inverse.\n\nE. Note that $e(2) = e(-3) = 5,$ so the function $e(x)$ does not have an inverse.\n\nF. Both $3^x$ and $7^x$ are increasing, so $f(x) = 3^x + 7^x$ is also increasing.  Hence, it has an inverse.\n\nG. Suppose $g(a) = g(b)$ for some $a,$ $b > 0.$  Then\n\\[a - \\frac{1}{a} = b - \\frac{1}{b}.\\]Multiplying both sides by $ab,$ we get\n\\[a^2 b - b = ab^2 - a.\\]Then $a^2 b - ab^2 + a - b = 0,$ which factors as $(a - b)(ab + 1) = 0.$  Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $ab + 1$ cannot be 0, so $a = b.$\n\nWe have shown that $g(a) = g(b)$ forces $a = b,$ so the function $g(x)$ has an inverse.\n\nH. The function $h(x) = \\frac{x}{2}$ has an inverse, namely $h^{-1}(x) = 2x.$\n\nThus, the letters of the functions that have inverses are $\\boxed{\\text{A, D, F, G, H}}.$"
