    "solution": "The first equation is equivalent to the following: if $a + b = 4$, then $f(a) = f(b)$. Similarly, the second equation is equivalent to the following: if $c + d = 14$, then $f(c) = f(d)$.\n\nThen note that for any $t$, we have \\[f(t) = f(4-t) = f(t+10),\\]because $t + (4-t) = 4$ and $(4-t) + (t+10) = 14$. This means that if $t$ is a root of $f$, then so is $t+10$, and conversely, if $t+10$ is a root of $f$, then so is $t$. Since $t = 0$ is a root, we see that if $n$ is a multiple of $10$, then $f(n) = 0$. We also have $f(4) = f(0)=0$, so if $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$, then $f(n) = 0$.\n\nTo see that these are all the necessary roots, observe that \\[f(x) = \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} 0 & \\quad \\text{if } x \\text{ is an integer and either } x \\equiv 0 \\! \\! \\! \\! \\pmod{10} \\text{ or } x \\equiv 4 \\!\\ \\! \\! \\! \\pmod{10} \\\\ 1 & \\quad \\text{otherwise} \\end{aligned} \\right.\\]satisfies all the given conditions, and only has these roots. This is because if $a+b=4$ and $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$, then $b \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$, and vice versa. Similarly, if $c + d = 14$ and $c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}$, then $d \\equiv 4 \\pmod{10}$, and vice versa.\n\nThere are $201$ multiples of $10$ in the given interval, and $200$ integers that are $4$ modulo $10$ in the given interval, making $201 + 200 = \\boxed{401}$ roots of $f.$"
