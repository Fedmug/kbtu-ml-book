    "solution": "We have that\n\\[\\sum_{i = 0}^{50} a_i x^i = \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{3} x + \\frac{1}{6} x^2 \\right) \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{3} x^3 + \\frac{1}{6} x^6 \\right) \\dotsm \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{3} x^9 + \\frac{1}{6} x^{18} \\right).\\]If we multiply this out (which we're not going to do), this involves taking a term from the first factor $1 - \\frac{1}{3} x + \\frac{1}{6} x^2,$ a term from the second factor $1 - \\frac{1}{3} x^3 + \\frac{1}{6} x^6,$ and so on, until we take a term from the fifth factor $1 - \\frac{1}{3} x^9 + \\frac{1}{6} x^{18},$ and taking the product of these terms.\n\nSuppose the product of the terms is of the form $cx^n,$ where $n$ is even.  Then the number of terms of odd degree, like $-\\frac{1}{3} x$ and $-\\frac{1}{3} x^3,$ that contributed must have been even.  These are the only terms from each factor that are negative, so $c$ must be positive.\n\nSimilarly, if $n$ is odd, then the number of terms of odd degree that contributed must be odd.  Therefore, $c$ is negative.  Hence,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{i = 0}^{50} |a_i| &= |a_0| + |a_1| + |a_2| + \\dots + |a_{50}| \\\\\n&= a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - \\dots + a_{50} \\\\\n&= Q(-1) \\\\\n&= P(-1)^5 \\\\\n&= \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{6} \\right)^5 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{\\frac{243}{32}}.\n\\end{align*}"
