    "problem": "What is the sum of the 2009 fractions of the form $\\frac{2}{n(n+2)}$ if the values of $n$ are the positive integers from 1 through 2009? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest thousandth.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We are asked to find  \\[\n\\frac{2}{1\\cdot3}+\\frac{2}{2\\cdot4}\n+\\frac{2}{3\\cdot5}\n+\\frac{2}{4\\cdot6}+\\cdots+\\frac{2}{2009\\cdot2011}.\n\\] Observe that $\\frac{2}{n(n+2)}$ may be written as $\\frac{1}{n}-\\frac{1}{n+2}$.  Applying this identity, our sum becomes \\[\n\\frac{1}{1}-\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}\n+\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{5}\n+\\frac{1}{4}-\\frac{1}{6}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{2009}-\\frac{1}{2011}.\n\\] Every negative term cancels with the term three places to the right.  The only terms which remain are \\[\n1+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2010}-\\frac{1}{2011}.\n\\] To the nearest thousandth, the sum is $\\boxed{1.499}$."
