    "problem": "Find the distance between the foci of the ellipse \\[x^2 + 4y^2 = 400.\\]",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Dividing by $400,$ we get \\[\\frac{x^2}{20^2} + \\frac{y^2}{10^2} = 1.\\]Thus, the length of the major and minor axes are $2 \\cdot 20 = 40$ and $2 \\cdot 10 = 20,$ respectively. Then the distance between the foci of the ellipse is $\\sqrt{40^2 - 20^2} = \\boxed{20\\sqrt3}.$"
