    "problem": "Find the value of $x,$ if \\[|x-20| + |x-18| = |2x-36|.\\]",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We recognize that $|2x-36| = 2|x-18|,$ so we get \\[|x-20| = |x-18|.\\]This means that, on the number line, $x$ is equidistant from $20$ and $18.$ Therefore $x$ must lie halfway between $20$ and $18,$ so \\[x = \\frac{20+18}{2} = \\boxed{19}.\\]"
