    "problem": "Solve the inequality\n\\[-12x^2 + 3x - 5 < 0.\\]",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "The discriminant of the quadratic is $3^2 - 4(-12)(-5) = -231,$ which is negative.  Therefore, the quadratic $-12x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0$ has no real roots.\n\nFurthermore, the coefficient of $x^2$ is $-12,$ which means that parabola is downward facing.  Therefore, the inequalities is satisfied for all real numbers $x \\in \\boxed{(-\\infty,\\infty)}.$"
