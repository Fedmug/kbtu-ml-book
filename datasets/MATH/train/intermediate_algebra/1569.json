    "problem": "Let $\\mathcal P$ be a parabola, and let $V_1$ and $F_1$ be its vertex and focus, respectively. Let $A$ and $B$ be points on $\\mathcal P$ so that $\\angle AV_1 B = 90^\\circ$. Let $\\mathcal Q$ be the locus of the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$. It turns out that $\\mathcal Q$ is also a parabola, and let $V_2$ and $F_2$ denote its vertex and focus, respectively. Determine the ratio $\\frac{F_1F_2}{V_1V_2}$.",

    "solution": "Since all parabolas are similar, we may assume that $\\mathcal P$ is the curve $y = x^2,$ so $V_1 = (0,0).$  Then, if $A = (a, a^2)$ and $B = (b, b^2)$, the slope of line $AV_1$ is $a,$ and the slope of line $BV_1$ is $b.$  Since $\\angle AV_1 B = 90^\\circ,$ $ab = -1$. Then, the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is \\[\n\\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, \\frac{(a+b)^2 - 2ab}{2} \\right)\n= \\left( \\frac{a+b}{2}, \\frac{(a+b)^2}{2} + 1 \\right).\n\\](Note that $a+b$ can range over all real numbers under the constraint $ab = - 1$.) It follows that the locus of the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ is the curve $y = 2x^2 + 1$.\n\nRecall that the focus of $y = ax^2$ is $\\left(0, \\frac{1}{4a} \\right)$. We find that $V_1 = (0,0)$, $V_2 = (0,1)$, $F_1 = \\left( 0, \\frac 14 \\right)$, $F_2 = \\left( 0, 1 + \\frac18 \\right)$. Therefore, $\\frac{F_1F_2}{V_1V_2} = \\boxed{\\frac78}$."
