    "solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference, and let $r$ be the common ratio, so $d$ and $r$ are positive integers.  Then $a_n = 1 + (n - 1) d$ and $b_n = r^{n - 1},$ so\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + (k - 2) d + r^{k - 2} &= 100, \\\\\n1 + kd + r^k &= 1000.\n\\end{align*}Then\n\\begin{align*}\n(k - 2) d + r^{k - 2} &= 99, \\\\\nkd + r^k &= 999.\n\\end{align*}From the second equation, $r^k < 999.$  If $k \\ge 4,$ then $r < 999^{1/4},$ so $r \\le 5.$\n\nSince the geometric sequence is increasing, $r \\neq 1,$ so the possible values of $r$ are 2, 3, 4, and 5.  We can write the equations above as\n\\begin{align*}\n(k - 2) d &= 99 - r^{k - 2}, \\\\\nkd &= 999 - r^k.\n\\end{align*}Thus, $99 - r^{k - 2}$ is divisible by $k - 2,$ and $999 - r^k$ is divisible by $k.$\n\nIf $r = 2,$ then the only possible values of $k$ are 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  We find that none of these values work.\n\nIf $r = 3,$ then the only possible values of $k$ are 4, 5, and 6.  We find that none of these values work.\n\nIf $r = 4,$ then the only possible values of $k$ is 4.  We find that this value does not work.\n\nIf $r = 4,$ then the only possible values of $k$ is 4.  We find that this value does not work.\n\nTherefore, we must have $k = 3,$ so\n\\begin{align*}\nd + r &= 99, \\\\\n3d + r^3 &= 999.\n\\end{align*}From the first equation, $d = 99 - r.$  Substituting, we get\n\\[3(99 - r) + r^3 = 999,\\]so $r^3 - 3r - 702 = 0.$  This factors as $(r - 9)(r^2 + 9r + 78) = 0,$ so $r = 9,$ so $d = 90.$  Then $a_3 = 1 + 2 \\cdot 90 = 181$ and $c_3 = 9^2 = 81,$ and $c_3 = 181 + 81 = \\boxed{262}.$"
