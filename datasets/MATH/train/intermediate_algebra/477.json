    "solution": "If $x^2-x-1$ is a factor of $ax^{17}+bx^{16}+1,$ then both the roots of $x^2-x-1$ must also be roots of $ax^{17}+bx^{16}+1.$ Let $s$ and $t$ be the roots of $x^2-x-1.$ Then we must have \\[as^{17} + bs^{16} + 1 = at^{17} + bt^{16} + 1 = 0.\\]Since $s$ is a root of $s^2-s-1=0,$ we have $s^2=s+1.$ This equation lets us express higher powers of $s$ in the form $Ms+N,$ for constants $M$ and $N.$ We have \\[\\begin{aligned} s^3 &= s^2 \\cdot s = (s+1)s = s^2+s=(s+1)+s=2s+1, \\\\ s^4 &= s^3 \\cdot s = (2s+1)s = 2s^2 + s = 2(s+1) + s = 3s+2, \\\\ s^5 &= s^4 \\cdot s =(3s+2)s = 3s^2+2s=3(s+1)+2s=5s+3, \\end{aligned}\\]and so on. Seeing a pattern, we guess that \\[s^n = F_ns + F_{n-1},\\]where $\\{F_n\\}$ are the Fibonacci numbers (with $F_1 = F_2 = 1,$ and $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \\ge 3$). We can prove this formula with induction (see below). This means that \\[s^{16} = F_{16}s + F_{15} = 987s + 610 \\; \\text{ and } \\; s^{17} = F_{17}s + F_{16} = 1597s + 987.\\]Thus, \\[as^{17} + bs^{16} + 1 = (1597a+987b)s + (987a+610b) + 1,\\]so it must be the case that $1597a + 987b = 0$ and $987a + 610b =- 1.$ This system has solutions $a = \\boxed{987}$ and $b = -1597.$\n\nProof of formula: We already did the base cases of the induction. If $s^n = F_ns + F_{n-1}$ for some value of $n,$ then \\[\\begin{aligned} s^{n+1} = s^n \\cdot s &= (F_ns + F_{n-1}) \\cdot s \\\\ &= F_ns^2 + F_{n-1}s\\\\ & = F_n(s+1) + F_{n-1}s\\\\ & = (F_n+F_{n-1})s + F_n = F_{n+1}s + F_n. \\end{aligned}\\]This completes the inductive step. $\\square$"
