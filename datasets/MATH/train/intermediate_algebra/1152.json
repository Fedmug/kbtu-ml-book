    "solution": "Since $q(x)$ is quadratic, and we have a horizontal asymptote at $y=0,$ we know that $p(x)$ must be linear.\n\nSince we have a hole at $x=0,$ there must be a factor of $x$ in both $p(x)$ and $q(x).$ Lastly, since there is a vertical asymptote at $x=1,$ the denominator $q(x)$ must have a factor of $x-1.$ Then, $p(x) = ax$ and $q(x) = bx(x-1),$ for some constants $a$ and $b.$ Since $p(3) = 3,$ we have $3a = 3$ and hence $a=1.$ Since $q(2) = 2,$ we have $2b(2-1) = 2$ and hence $b=1.$\n\nSo $p(x) = x$ and $q(x) = x(x - 1) = x^2 - x,$ and $p(x) + q(x) = \\boxed{x^2}$."
