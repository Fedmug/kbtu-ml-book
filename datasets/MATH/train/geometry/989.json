    "problem": "A square is inscribed in a circle.  A smaller square has one side coinciding with a side of the larger square and has two vertices on the circle, as shown.  What percent of the area of the larger square is the area of the smaller square?\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1.4142));\ndraw((1,1)--(1,-1)--(-1,-1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0.2,1)--(0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1));\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1.4142));\ndraw((1,1)--(1,-1)--(-1,-1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0.2,1)--(0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1.4),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0.2,1.4),NE);\ndot((0,0)); dot((0,1.4)); dot((0.2,1.4));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1.4)--(0.2,1.4)--cycle,red);\n[/asy]\n\nWe label the points as shown.  $A$ is the midpoint of the top side of the square, and $B$ is a vertex of the square.  We look at right triangle $\\triangle OAB$.  We seek a ratio of areas, which remains constant no matter the side lengths, so for simplicity, we let the big square have side length $2$ and the small square have side length $2x$.  Then, $OA=1+2x$, $AB=x$, and $OB$ is a radius of the circle, which has length $\\sqrt{2}$ by 45-45-90 triangles.  Then, the Pythagorean theorem states that $OA^2+AB^2=OB^2$, or \\[(1+2x)^2 + x^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2.\\]   Simplifying the equation yields \\begin{align*}\n& 1+4x+4x^2 + x^2 = 2 \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow\\ & 5x^2 + 4x-1 =0 \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow\\ & (5x-1)(x+1).\n\\end{align*} Thus, $x=-1$ or $x=1/5$.  Lengths are clearly positive, so the valid solution is $x=1/5$.  Then the small square has side length $2x=2/5$, and area $(2/5)^2 = 4/25$.  The large square has area $2^2=4$, so the small square has \\[\\frac{4/25}{4}=1/25=\\boxed{4\\%}\\] the area of the large square."
