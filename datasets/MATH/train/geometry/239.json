    "solution": "Since the square and the equilateral triangle share a side, all sides of the square are the same length as all sides of the equilateral triangle. Specifically, we have $CD=CB$, and so $\\triangle BCD$ is isosceles with equal angles at $B$ and $D$. Let $x$ denote the number of degrees in the measure of each of these two angles (that is, $x^\\circ=m\\angle CDB=m\\angle CBD$).\n\nAngle $\\angle BCD$ is equal to $90^\\circ+60^\\circ = 150^\\circ$ (since a square and an equilateral triangle have interior angles of $90^\\circ$ and $60^\\circ$, respectively). Since the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have $$x + x + 150 = 180,$$ giving $x=\\boxed{15}$."
