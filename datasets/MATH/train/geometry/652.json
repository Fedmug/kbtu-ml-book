    "problem": "A circle with a radius of 2 units has its center at $(0, 0)$. A circle with a radius of 7 units has its center at $(15, 0)$. A line tangent to both circles intersects the $x$-axis at $(x, 0)$ to the right of the origin. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "To begin, we can draw a diagram as shown: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,8)--(0,-8),linewidth(.5));\ndraw((-4,0)--(23,0),linewidth(.5));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2),linewidth(.7));\ndraw(Circle((15,0),7),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((-2,-4)--(14,8),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(1.3,-1.5),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((15,0)--(10.7,5.5),linewidth(.7));\nlabel(\"\\tiny{2}\",(-.5,-1));\nlabel(\"\\tiny{7}\",(14,3));\n[/asy] By drawing in radii to the tangent line, we have formed two right triangles, one with hypotenuse $x$ and the other with hypotenuse $15-x$.  Notice that the angles at the $x$ axis are vertical angles and are also congruent.  So, these two triangles are similar, and we can set up a ratio: $$\\frac{x}{15-x}=\\frac{2}{7}$$ $$7x=30-2x$$ $$9x=30$$ $$x=\\boxed{\\frac{10}{3}}$$"
