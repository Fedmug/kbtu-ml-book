    "problem": "Equilateral $\\triangle ABC$ has side length $600$. Points $P$ and $Q$ lie outside the plane of $\\triangle ABC$ and are on opposite sides of the plane. Furthermore, $PA=PB=PC$, and $QA=QB=QC$, and the planes of $\\triangle PAB$ and $\\triangle QAB$ form a $120^{\\circ}$ dihedral angle (the angle between the two planes). There is a point $O$ whose distance from each of $A,B,C,P,$ and $Q$ is $d$. Find $d$.\n",

    "solution": "The inradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is $100\\sqrt 3$ and the circumradius is $200 \\sqrt 3$. Now, consider the line perpendicular to plane $ABC$ through the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$. Note that $P,Q,O$ must lie on that line to be equidistant from each of the triangle's vertices. Also, note that since $P, Q, O$ are collinear, and $OP=OQ$, we must have $O$ is the midpoint of $PQ$. Now, Let $K$ be the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$, and $L$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. We must have $\\tan(\\angle KLP+ \\angle QLK)= \\tan(120^{\\circ})$. Setting $KP=x$ and $KQ=y$, assuming WLOG $x>y$, we must have $\\tan(120^{\\circ})=-\\sqrt{3}=\\dfrac{\\dfrac{x+y}{100 \\sqrt{3}}}{\\dfrac{30000-xy}{30000}}$. Therefore, we must have $100(x+y)=xy-30000$. Also, we must have $\\left(\\dfrac{x+y}{2}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\dfrac{x-y}{2}\\right)^{2}+120000$ by the Pythagorean theorem, so we have $xy=120000$, so substituting into the other equation we have $90000=100(x+y)$, or $x+y=900$. Since we want $\\dfrac{x+y}{2}$, the desired answer is $\\boxed{450}$."
