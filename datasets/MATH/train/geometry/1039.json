    "solution": "First, let us denote the radius of cylinder A (and height of cylinder B) as $r$, and the height of cylinder A (and radius of cylinder B) as $h$.  Therefore, if the volume of cylinder A is double that of B, then: $\\frac{\\text{Volume of Cylinder A}}{\\text{Volume of Cylinder B}} = \\frac{r^2 \\cdot h}{h^2 \\cdot r} = \\frac{r}{h} = 2$.  Therefore, normally the volume of Cylinder A is expressed as $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot h$, and plugging in $r = 2h$, we see that the volume of Cylinder A $= 4\\pi \\cdot h^3$, hence $N = \\boxed{4}$."
