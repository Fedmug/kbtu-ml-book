    "solution": "Call the length of a side of the cube x. Thus, the volume of the cube is $x^3$. We can then find that a side of this regular octahedron is the square root of $(\\frac{x}{2})^2$+$(\\frac{x}{2})^2$ which is equivalent to $\\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Using our general formula for the volume of a regular octahedron of side length a, which is $\\frac{a^3\\sqrt2}{3}$, we get that the volume of this octahedron is...\n$(\\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2})^3 \\rightarrow \\frac{x^3\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\rightarrow \\frac{x^3\\sqrt{2}}{4}*\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\rightarrow \\frac{2x^3}{12}=\\frac{x^3}{6}$\nComparing the ratio of the volume of the octahedron to the cube isâ€¦\n$\\frac{\\frac{x^3}{6}}{x^3} \\rightarrow \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$"
