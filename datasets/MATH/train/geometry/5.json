    "problem": "A cube with an edge length of 4 units has the same volume as a square-based pyramid with base edge lengths of 8 units and a height of $h$ units. What is the value of $h$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The cube has volume $4^3=64$.  The pyramid has volume $\\frac{1}{3}8^2h$.  So\n\n$$64=\\frac{64}{3}h\\Rightarrow h=\\boxed{3}$$"
