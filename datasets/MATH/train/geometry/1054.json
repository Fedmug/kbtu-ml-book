    "problem": "A right, rectangular prism has three faces with areas of $6,8$ and $12$ square inches. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic inches?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=6$, $wh=8$, and $lh=12$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=6\\cdot8\\cdot12=3\\cdot2\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^2\\cdot3=2^6\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^3\\cdot3=\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches."
