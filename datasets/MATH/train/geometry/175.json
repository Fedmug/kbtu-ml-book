    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has sides of length 5, 12 and 13 units, and triangle $DEF$ has sides of length 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $DEF$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are both right, since their sides form Pythagorean triples. It follows that the desired ratio is $\\dfrac{(5\\cdot 12)/2}{(8\\cdot 15)/2} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$."
