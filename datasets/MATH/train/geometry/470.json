    "solution": "We can look at the region as a rectangle with a smaller staircase-shaped region removed from its upper-right corner.  We extend two of its sides to complete the rectangle: [asy]\nsize(120);\ndraw((5,7)--(0,7)--(0,0)--(9,0)--(9,3)--(8,3)--(8,4)--(7,4)--(7,5)--(6,5)--(6,6)--(5,6)--cycle);\ndraw((5,7)--(9,7)--(9,3),dashed);\n[/asy] Dissecting the small staircase, we see it consists of ten 1 ft by 1 ft squares and thus has area 10 square feet. [asy]\nsize(120);\ndraw((5,7)--(0,7)--(0,0)--(9,0)--(9,3)--(8,3)--(8,4)--(7,4)--(7,5)--(6,5)--(6,6)--(5,6)--cycle);\ndraw((5,7)--(9,7)--(9,3),dashed);\ndraw((8,7)--(8,4)--(9,4),dashed); draw((7,7)--(7,5)--(9,5),dashed); draw((6,7)--(6,6)--(9,6),dashed);\n[/asy] Let the height of the rectangle have length $x$ feet, so the area of the rectangle is $9x$ square feet.  Thus we can write the area of the staircase-shaped region as $9x-10$.  Setting this equal to $53$ and solving for $x$ yields $9x-10=53 \\Rightarrow x=7$ feet.\n\nFinally, the perimeter of the region is $7+9+3+5+8\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{32}$ feet.  (Notice how this is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle -- if we shift each horizontal side with length 1 upwards and each vertical side with length 1 rightwards, we get a rectangle.)"
