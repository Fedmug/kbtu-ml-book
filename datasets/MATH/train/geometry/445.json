    "problem": "A dump truck delivered sand to a construction site. The sand formed a conical pile with a diameter of $8$ feet and a height that was $75\\%$ of the diameter. How many cubic feet of sand were in the pile? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The height of the cone is $\\frac{3}{4} \\times 8 = 6$. The radius of the cone is $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$. Therefore, the volume of the cone formed is $\\frac{4^2 \\times 6 \\times \\pi}{3} = \\boxed{32 \\pi}$."
