    "problem": "One leg of a right triangle is 12 inches, and the measure of the angle opposite that leg is $30^\\circ$. What is the number of inches in the hypotenuse of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level ?",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "A right triangle with a $30^\\circ$ angle is a 30-60-90 triangle.  In such a triangle, the hypotenuse has twice the length of the leg opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle, so the hypotenuse of the triangle in the problem has length $2\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$ inches."
