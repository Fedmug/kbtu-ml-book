    "solution": "The semi-circle with diameter BC has radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ that of the semi-circle with diameter AB, and thus, has $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the area.  (Area of a circle $= \\pi \\times r^2$ - thus, if $r$ is half as large, that will be squared in the process).  Therefore, the sum of their areas represents $\\frac{5}{8}$ of a circle with diameter AB, and since the line CP splits this area exactly in half, that area would be $\\frac{5}{16}$ of a circle with diameter AB.  Therefore, the degree measure of that sector is $360 \\times \\frac{5}{16} = \\boxed{112.5}$"
