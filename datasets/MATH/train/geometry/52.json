    "problem": "Point $A$ has coordinates $(x,6)$. When Point $A$ is reflected over the $y$-axis it lands on Point $B$. What is the sum of the four coordinate values of points $A$ and $B$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The coordinates of point $B$ are $(-x,6)$.  The sum of all four coordinates is $x+6+(-x)+6=\\boxed{12}$."
