    "solution": "Since $PQ$ is parallel to $SR,$ the height of $\\triangle PQS$ (considering $PQ$ as the base) and the height of $\\triangle SRQ$ (considering $SR$ as the base) are the same (that is, the vertical distance between $PQ$ and $SR$).\n\nSince $SR$ is twice the length of $PQ$ and the heights are the same, the area of $\\triangle SRQ$ is twice the area of $\\triangle PQS.$ In other words, the area of $\\triangle PQS$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the total area of the trapezoid, or $\\frac{1}{3}\\times 12 = \\boxed{4}.$"
