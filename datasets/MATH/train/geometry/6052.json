    "solution": "Call the squares' side lengths from smallest to largest $a_1,\\ldots,a_9$, and let $l,w$ represent the dimensions of the rectangle.\nThe picture shows that\\begin{align*} a_1+a_2 &= a_3\\\\ a_1 + a_3 &= a_4\\\\ a_3 + a_4 &= a_5\\\\ a_4 + a_5 &= a_6\\\\ a_2 + a_3 + a_5 &= a_7\\\\ a_2 + a_7 &= a_8\\\\ a_1 + a_4 + a_6 &= a_9\\\\ a_6 + a_9 &= a_7 + a_8.\\end{align*}\nExpressing all terms 3 to 9 in terms of $a_1$ and $a_2$ and substituting their expanded forms into the previous equation will give the expression $5a_1 = 2a_2$.\nWe can guess that $a_1 = 2$. (If we started with $a_1$ odd, the resulting sides would not be integers and we would need to scale up by a factor of $2$ to make them integers; if we started with $a_1 > 2$ even, the resulting dimensions would not be relatively prime and we would need to scale down.) Then solving gives $a_9 = 36$, $a_6=25$, $a_8 = 33$, which gives us $l=61,w=69$. These numbers are relatively prime, as desired. The perimeter is $2(61)+2(69)=\\boxed{260}$."
