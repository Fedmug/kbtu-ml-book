    "problem": "The diagonal of a particular square is 5 inches.  The diameter of a particular circle is also 5 inches.  By how many square inches is the area of the circle greater than the area of square?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle);\ndraw((2,0)--(0,2));\n\ndraw(circle((4.5,1),1.414));\ndraw((2+3.5,0)--(0+3.5,2));\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "Let the side length of the square be $s$, so the area of the square is $s^2$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(75);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle);\ndraw((2,0)--(0,2));\nlabel(\"$s$\",(1,0),S); label(\"$s$\",(0,1),W); label(\"$5$\",(1,1),NE);\n[/asy] By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $s^2+s^2=5^2$, so $2s^2=25$ and $s^2=\\frac{25}{2}$, so the area of the square is $\\frac{25}{2}=12.5$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(85);\ndraw(circle((1,1),1.414));\ndraw((2,0)--(0,2));\nlabel(\"$5$\",(1,1),NE);\n[/asy] Since the diameter of the circle is $5$, its radius is $\\frac{5}{2}$, and its area is $\\pi \\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\displaystyle\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{4}\\pi$, which is approximately $19.63$.\n\nThe difference between the two areas is approximately $19.63 - 12.5 = 7.13$, which, to the nearest tenth, is $7.1$.  Thus the area of the circle is greater than the area of the square by $\\boxed{7.1}$ square inches."
