Without loss of generality, let $AC < AB$, so that $E$ is between $D$ and $C$. Let the length of the median be $3m$. Then by two applications of the Power of a Point Theorem, $DE^2 = 2m \\cdot m = AF^2$, so $DE = AF$. Now, $CE$ and $CF$ are two tangents to a circle from the same point, so by the Two Tangent Theorem $CE = CF = c$ and thus $AC = AF + CF = DE + CE = CD = 10$. Then $DE = AF = AG = 10 - c$ so $BG = BE = BD + DE = 20 - c$ and thus $AB = AG + BG = 30 - 2c$.\nNow, by Stewart's Theorem in triangle $\\triangle ABC$ with cevian $\\overline{AD}$, we have\n\\[(3m)^2\\cdot 20 + 20\\cdot10\\cdot10 = 10^2\\cdot10 + (30 - 2c)^2\\cdot 10.\\]\nOur earlier result from Power of a Point was that $2m^2 = (10 - c)^2$, so we combine these two results to solve for $c$ and we get\n\\[9(10 - c)^2 + 200 = 100 + (30 - 2c)^2 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad c^2 - 12c + 20 = 0.\\]\nThus $c = 2$ or $= 10$. We discard the value $c = 10$ as extraneous (it gives us a line) and are left with $c = 2$, so our triangle has area $\\sqrt{28 \\cdot 18 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2} = 24\\sqrt{14}$ and so the answer is $24 + 14 = \\boxed{38}$."
