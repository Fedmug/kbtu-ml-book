    "problem": "The points $A$, $B$ and $C$ lie on the surface of a sphere with center $O$ and radius $20$. It is given that $AB=13$, $BC=14$, $CA=15$, and that the distance from $O$ to $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}k$, where $m$, $n$, and $k$ are positive integers, $m$ and $k$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+k$.\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to the plane of $ABC$. By the Pythagorean Theorem on triangles $\\triangle OAD$, $\\triangle OBD$ and $\\triangle OCD$ we get:\n\\[DA^2=DB^2=DC^2=20^2-OD^2\\]\nIt follows that $DA=DB=DC$, so $D$ is the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nBy Heron's Formula the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is (alternatively, a $13-14-15$ triangle may be split into $9-12-15$ and $5-12-13$ right triangles):\n\\[K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{21(21-15)(21-14)(21-13)} = 84\\]\nFrom $R = \\frac{abc}{4K}$, we know that the circumradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is:\n\\[R = \\frac{abc}{4K} = \\frac{(13)(14)(15)}{4(84)} = \\frac{65}{8}\\]\nThus by the Pythagorean Theorem again,\n\\[OD = \\sqrt{20^2-R^2} = \\sqrt{20^2-\\frac{65^2}{8^2}} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{95}}{8}.\\]\nSo the final answer is $15+95+8=\\boxed{118}$."
