    "problem": "A tetrahedron with four equilateral triangular faces has a sphere inscribed within it and a sphere circumscribed about it. For each of the four faces, there is a sphere tangent externally to the face at its center and to the circumscribed sphere. A point $P$ is selected at random inside the circumscribed sphere. The probability that $P$ lies inside one of the five small spheres is closest to\n$\\mathrm{(A) \\ }0 \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\ }0.1 \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\ }0.2 \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\ }0.3 \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\ }0.4$\n",

    "solution": "Let the radius of the large sphere be $R$, and of the inner sphere $r$. Label the vertices of the tetrahedron $ABCD$, and let $O$ be the center. Then pyramid $[OABC] + [OABD] + [OACD] + [OBCD] = [ABCD]$, where $[\\ldots]$ denotes volume; thus $[OABC] = \\frac{[ABCD]}{4}$. Since $OABC$ and $ABCD$ are both pyramids that share a common face $ABC$, the ratio of their volumes is the ratio of their altitudes to face $ABC$, so $r = \\frac {h_{ABCD}}4$. However, $h_{ABCD} = r + R$, so it follows that $r = \\frac {R}{3}$. Then the radius of an external sphere is $\\frac{R-r}2 = \\frac {R}{3} = r$.\nSince the five described spheres are non-intersecting, it follows that the ratio of the volumes of the spheres is $5 \\cdot \\left( \\frac 13 \\right)^3 = \\frac{5}{27} \\approx \\boxed{.2}$."
