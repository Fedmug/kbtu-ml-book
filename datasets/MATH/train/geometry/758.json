    "problem": "One of the five faces of the triangular prism shown here will be used as the base of a new pyramid. The numbers of exterior faces, vertices and edges of the resulting shape (the fusion of the prism and pyramid) are added.

    "solution": "The original prism has 5 faces, 9 edges, and 6 vertices.  If the new pyramid is added to a triangular face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 3 new faces.  If instead the new pyramid is added to a quadrilateral face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 4 new edges, and 4 new faces.  So, we maximize the sum by adding a pyramid to a quadrilateral face.  This gives us a solid with $5-1+4 = 8$ faces, $9+4=13$ edges, and $6 + 1 = 7$ vertices.  The sum of these is $\\boxed{28}$."
