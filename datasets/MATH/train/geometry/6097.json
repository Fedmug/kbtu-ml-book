    "solution": "Rewrite the given equations as $(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 256$ and $(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 16$.\nLet $w_3$ have center $(x,y)$ and radius $r$. Now, if two circles with radii $r_1$ and $r_2$ are externally tangent, then the distance between their centers is $r_1 + r_2$, and if they are internally tangent, it is $|r_1 - r_2|$. So we have\n\\begin{align*} r + 4 &= \\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\\\ 16 - r &= \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\end{align*}\nSolving for $r$ in both equations and setting them equal, then simplifying, yields\n\\begin{align*} 20 - \\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} &= \\sqrt{(x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\\\ 20+x &= 2\\sqrt{(x+5)^2 + (y-12)^2} \\end{align*}\nSquaring again and canceling yields $1 = \\frac{x^2}{100} + \\frac{(y-12)^2}{75}.$\nSo the locus of points that can be the center of the circle with the desired properties is an ellipse.\n[asy] size(220); pointpen = black; pen d = linewidth(0.7); pathpen = d;  pair A = (-5, 12), B = (5, 12), C = (0, 0); D(CR(A,16));D(CR(B,4));D(shift((0,12)) * yscale(3^.5 / 2) * CR(C,10), linetype(\"2 2\") + d + red); D((0,30)--(0,-10),Arrows(4));D((15,0)--(-25,0),Arrows(4));D((0,0)--MP(\"y=ax\",(14,14 * (69/100)^.5),E),EndArrow(4));  void bluecirc (real x) {  pair P = (x, (3 * (25 - x^2 / 4))^.5 + 12); dot(P, blue);  D(CR(P, ((P.x - 5)^2 + (P.y - 12)^2)^.5 - 4) , blue + d + linetype(\"4 4\")); }  bluecirc(-9.2); bluecirc(-4); bluecirc(3); [/asy]\nSince the center lies on the line $y = ax$, we substitute for $y$ and expand:\\[1 = \\frac{x^2}{100} + \\frac{(ax-12)^2}{75} \\Longrightarrow (3+4a^2)x^2 - 96ax + 276 = 0.\\]\nWe want the value of $a$ that makes the line $y=ax$ tangent to the ellipse, which will mean that for that choice of $a$ there is only one solution to the most recent equation. But a quadratic has one solution iff its discriminant is $0$, so $(-96a)^2 - 4(3+4a^2)(276) = 0$.\nSolving yields $a^2 = \\frac{69}{100}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{169}$."
