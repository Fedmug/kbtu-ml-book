    "problem": "Let $A = (0,0)$ and $B = (b,2)$ be points on the coordinate plane. Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex equilateral hexagon such that $\\angle FAB = 120^\\circ,$ $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{DE},$ $\\overline{BC}\\parallel \\overline{EF,}$ $\\overline{CD}\\parallel \\overline{FA},$ and the y-coordinates of its vertices are distinct elements of the set $\\{0,2,4,6,8,10\\}.$ The area of the hexagon can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n.$\n",

    "solution": "The y-coordinate of $F$ must be $4$. All other cases yield non-convex and/or degenerate hexagons, which violate the problem statement.\nLetting $F = (f,4)$, and knowing that $\\angle FAB = 120^\\circ$, we can use rewrite $F$ using complex numbers: $f + 4 i = (b + 2 i)\\left(e^{i(2 \\pi / 3)}\\right) = (b + 2 i)\\left(-1/2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i\\right) = -\\frac{b}{2}-\\sqrt{3}+\\left(\\frac{b\\sqrt{3}}{2}-1\\right)i$. We solve for $b$ and $f$ and find that $F = \\left(-\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}, 4\\right)$ and that $B = \\left(\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}}, 2\\right)$.\nThe area of the hexagon can then be found as the sum of the areas of two congruent triangles ($EFA$ and $BCD$, with height $8$ and base $\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}$) and a parallelogram ($ABDE$, with height $8$ and base $\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}}$).\n$A = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}} + 8 \\times \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{144}{\\sqrt{3}} = 48\\sqrt{3}$.\nThus, $m+n = \\boxed{51}$."
