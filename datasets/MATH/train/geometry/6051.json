If we graph those points, we notice that since the latter four points are all reflected across the x/y-axis, they form a rectangle, and $ABE$ is a triangle. The area of $BCDE$ is $(2u)(2v) = 4uv$ and the area of $ABE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(2u)(u-v) = u^2 - uv$. Adding these together, we get $u^2 + 3uv = u(u+3v) = 451 = 11 \\cdot 41$. Since $u,v$ are positive, $u+3v>u$, and by matching factors we get either $(u,v) = (1,150)$ or $(11,10)$. Since $v < u$ the latter case is the answer, and $u+v = \\boxed{21}$."
