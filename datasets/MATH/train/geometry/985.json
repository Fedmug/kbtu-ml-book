    "solution": "At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees."
