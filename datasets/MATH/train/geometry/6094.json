Let the vertices of the octahedron be $A, B, C, D, E, F$ so that $A$ and $F$ are opposite each other and $AF = s\\sqrt2$. The height of the square pyramid $ABCDE$ is $\\frac{AF}2 = \\frac s{\\sqrt2}$ and so it has volume $\\frac 13 s^2 \\cdot \\frac s{\\sqrt2} = \\frac {s^3}{3\\sqrt2}$ and the whole octahedron has volume $\\frac {s^3\\sqrt2}3$.\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$, $N$ be the midpoint of $DE$, $G$ be the centroid of $\\triangle ABC$ and $H$ be the centroid of $\\triangle ADE$. Then $\\triangle AMN \\sim \\triangle AGH$ and the symmetry ratio is $\\frac 23$ (because the medians of a triangle are trisected by the centroid), so $GH = \\frac{2}{3}MN = \\frac{2s}3$. $GH$ is also a diagonal of the cube, so the cube has side-length $\\frac{s\\sqrt2}3$ and volume $\\frac{2s^3\\sqrt2}{27}$. The ratio of the volumes is then $\\frac{\\left(\\frac{2s^3\\sqrt2}{27}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{s^3\\sqrt2}{3}\\right)} = \\frac29$ and so the answer is $\\boxed{11}$."
