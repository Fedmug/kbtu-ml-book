    "solution": "The base of the hemisphere is a circle with radius 6 and area $6^2\\pi=36\\pi$.  The curved top of the hemisphere has half the surface area of a full sphere, which has surface area $4\\pi(6^2)=144\\pi$, so the curved top of the hemisphere has $144\\pi/2=72\\pi$.  The total surface area of the hemisphere is $36\\pi+72\\pi=\\boxed{108\\pi}$."
