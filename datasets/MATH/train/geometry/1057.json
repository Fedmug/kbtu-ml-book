    "problem": "Each edge length of a rectangular solid is a prime number. If the volume of the rectangular solid is 385 cubic units, what is the total surface area, in square units, of the rectangular solid?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Prime factorize $385$ as $5\\cdot7\\cdot 11$.  The surface area of a rectangular solid having side lengths of 5, 7, and 11 units is $2(5\\cdot7+7\\cdot11+11\\cdot5)=\\boxed{334}$ square units."
