    "problem": "For his birthday, Bert gets a box that holds $125$ jellybeans when filled to capacity. A few weeks later, Carrie gets a larger box full of jellybeans. Her box is twice as high, twice as wide and twice as long as Bert's. Approximately, how many jellybeans did Carrie get?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since the exact dimensions of Bert's box do not matter, assume the box is $1 \\times 2 \\times 3$.  Its volume is 6.  Carrie's box is $2 \\times 4 \\times 6$, so its volume is 48 or 8 times the volume of Bert's box.  Carrie has approximately $8(125) = \\boxed{1000}$ jellybeans.\n$\\textbf{Note:}$ Other examples may help to see that the ratio is always 8 to 1."
