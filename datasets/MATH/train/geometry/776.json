Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFM$ is a right triangle.  We are given $PF = 12$, and we have $FM = (1/2)(AB) = 5$, so the Pythagorean Theorem gives us $PM = \\sqrt{PF^2 + FM^2} = 13$.  Therefore, since the four lateral faces are congruent triangles, the total surface area of the pyramid is \\[[ABCD] + 4[PAB] = 10^2 + 4(13)(10)/2 = \\boxed{360}\\text{ square centimeters}.\\]"
