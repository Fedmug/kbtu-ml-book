    "problem": "Let $S$ be a square of side length $1$. Two points are chosen independently at random on the sides of $S$. The probability that the straight-line distance between the points is at least $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ is $\\dfrac{a-b\\pi}{c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers with $\\gcd(a,b,c)=1$. What is $a+b+c$?\n$\\textbf{(A) }59\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }60\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }61\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }62\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }63$\n",

    "solution": "Divide the boundary of the square into halves, thereby forming $8$ segments. Without loss of generality, let the first point $A$ be in the bottom-left segment. Then, it is easy to see that any point in the $5$ segments not bordering the bottom-left segment will be distance at least $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ apart from $A$. Now, consider choosing the second point on the bottom-right segment. The probability for it to be distance at least $0.5$ apart from $A$ is $\\dfrac{0 + 1}{2} = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ because of linearity of the given probability. (Alternatively, one can set up a coordinate system and use geometric probability.)\nIf the second point $B$ is on the left-bottom segment, then if $A$ is distance $x$ away from the left-bottom vertex, then $B$ must be up to $\\dfrac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{0.25 - x^2}$ away from the left-middle point. Thus, using an averaging argument we find that the probability in this case is\\[\\frac{1}{\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^2} \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\dfrac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{0.25 - x^2} dx = 4\\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\pi}{16} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4}.\\]\n(Alternatively, one can equate the problem to finding all valid $(x, y)$ with $0 < x, y < \\dfrac{1}{2}$ such that $x^2 + y^2 \\ge \\dfrac{1}{4}$, i.e. $(x, y)$ is outside the unit circle with radius $0.5.$)\nThus, averaging the probabilities gives\\[P = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( 5 + \\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{32} \\left( 26 - \\pi \\right).\\]\nOur answer is $\\boxed{59}$."
