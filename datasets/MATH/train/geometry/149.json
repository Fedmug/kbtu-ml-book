    "problem": "Triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle and O is the center of its inscribed circle. If the area of the circle is $4\\pi$ sq cm, what is the area, in square centimeters, of triangle ABC? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nNote: The area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2.$",

    "solution": "First, we note that the radius of the inscribed circle is 2 cm (since $\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi$ implies that $r=2$, given that $r$ is nonnegative).\n\nLet $X$ be the midpoint of side $BC$. Thus segment $OX$ is a radius of the inscribed circle: [asy]\nunitsize(16);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw(((-2*sqrt(3),-2)--(2*sqrt(3),-2)--(0,4)--cycle));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,-2)));\ndraw(((-sqrt(3),1)--(0,0)--(sqrt(3),1)));\ndot((0,4)); label(\"A\",(0,4),N);\ndot((-2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"B\",(-2*sqrt(3),-2),SW);\ndot((2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"C\",(2*sqrt(3),-2),SE);\ndot((0,0)); label(\"O\",(0,0),N);\ndot((0,-2)); label(\"X\",(0,-2),S);\ndot((-sqrt(3),1)); dot((sqrt(3),1));\nlabel(\"2\",(0,-1),E);\n[/asy] Then $COX$ is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $OX$, $CX$, and $CO$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Since $OX=2$, we have $CX=2\\sqrt 3$.\n\nTriangle $ACX$ is also a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $CX$, $AX$, and $AC$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Thus, $AX=(2\\sqrt3)(\\sqrt 3)=6$.\n\nTriangle $ABC$ has base $BC = 2(XC) = 4\\sqrt 3$ and corresponding height $AX = 6$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(4\\sqrt 3)(6) = \\boxed{12\\sqrt 3}$."
