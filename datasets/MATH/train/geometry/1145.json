    "problem": "A regular polygon has an exterior angle that measures $15$ degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$ as long as we take only one exterior angle per vertex. The polygon is regular, so all of the exterior angles have the same degree measure of $15$ degrees. If the polygon has $n$ sides, then the sum of the exterior angles is $15n=360$. So $n=24$ and the polygon has $\\boxed{24}$ sides."
