    "problem": "The radius of a sphere is $p$ units and the radius of a hemisphere is $2p$ units. What is the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the hemisphere?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi p^3\\] and the volume of the hemisphere is \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2p)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi p^3 \\cdot 4.\\] Thus the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the hemisphere is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
