    "problem": "$B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$. $MC = 8$. How many units are in the length of $\\overline{AD}$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since $MC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, we have $MB=MC = 8$, so $BC=8+8=16$.  Since $B$ and $C$ trisect $\\overline{AD}$, we have $AB = CD = BC = 16$, so $AD =16+16+16=\\boxed{48}$."
