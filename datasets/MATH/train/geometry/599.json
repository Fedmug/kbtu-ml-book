    "problem": "The length of the median to the hypotenuse of an isosceles, right triangle is $10$ units.  What is the length of a leg of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The length of the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse, so the hypotenuse is $10\\cdot2=20$ units long. Since the right triangle is isosceles, the length of a leg is $20/\\sqrt{2}=\\boxed{10\\sqrt{2}}$ units."
