    "problem": "In $\\triangle ABC$, the sides have integer lengths and $AB=AC$. Circle $\\omega$ has its center at the incenter of $\\triangle ABC$. An excircle of $\\triangle ABC$ is a circle in the exterior of $\\triangle ABC$ that is tangent to one side of the triangle and tangent to the extensions of the other two sides. Suppose that the excircle tangent to $\\overline{BC}$ is internally tangent to $\\omega$, and the other two excircles are both externally tangent to $\\omega$. Find the minimum possible value of the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$.\n",

    "solution": "Let the tangent circle be $\\omega$. Some notation first: let $BC=a$, $AB=b$, $s$ be the semiperimeter, $\\theta=\\angle ABC$, and $r$ be the inradius. Intuition tells us that the radius of $\\omega$ is $r+\\frac{2rs}{s-a}$ (using the exradius formula). However, the sum of the radius of $\\omega$ and $\\frac{rs}{s-b}$ is equivalent to the distance between the incenter and the the $B/C$ excenter. Denote the B excenter as $I_B$ and the incenter as $I$. Lemma: $I_BI=\\frac{2b*IB}{a}$ We draw the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$. Let the angle bisector of $\\angle ABC$ hit the circumcircle at a second point $M$. By the incenter-excenter lemma, $AM=CM=IM$. Let this distance be $\\alpha$. Ptolemy's theorem on $ABCM$ gives us\\[a\\alpha+b\\alpha=b(\\alpha+IB)\\to \\alpha=\\frac{b*IB}{a}\\]Again, by the incenter-excenter lemma, $II_B=2IM$ so $II_b=\\frac{2b*IB}{a}$ as desired. Using this gives us the following equation:\\[\\frac{2b*IB}{a}=r+\\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\\frac{rs}{s-b}\\]Motivated by the $s-a$ and $s-b$, we make the following substitution: $x=s-a, y=s-b$ This changes things quite a bit. Here's what we can get from it:\\[a=2y, b=x+y, s=x+2y\\]It is known (easily proved with Heron's and a=rs) that\\[r=\\sqrt{\\frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-b)}{s}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}}\\]Using this, we can also find $IB$: let the midpoint of $BC$ be $N$. Using Pythagorean's Theorem on $\\triangle INB$,\\[IB^2=r^2+(\\frac{a}{2})^2=\\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}+y^2=\\frac{2xy^2+2y^3}{x+2y}=\\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}\\]We now look at the RHS of the main equation:\\[r+\\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\\frac{rs}{s-b}=r(1+\\frac{2(x+2y)}{x}+\\frac{x+2y}{y})=r(\\frac{x^2+5xy+4y^2}{xy})=\\frac{r(x+4y)(x+y)}{xy}=\\frac{2(x+y)IB}{2y}\\]Cancelling some terms, we have\\[\\frac{r(x+4y)}{x}=IB\\]Squaring,\\[\\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}=\\frac{(x+4y)^2*xy^2}{x^2(x+2y)}\\to \\frac{(x+4y)^2}{x}=2(x+y)\\]Expanding and moving terms around gives\\[(x-8y)(x+2y)=0\\to x=8y\\]Reverse substituting,\\[s-a=8s-8b\\to b=\\frac{9}{2}a\\]Clearly the smallest solution is $a=2$ and $b=9$, so our answer is $2+9+9=\\boxed{20}$."
