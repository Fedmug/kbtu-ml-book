    "problem": "The rectangle $ABCD$ below has dimensions $AB = 12 \\sqrt{3}$ and $BC = 13 \\sqrt{3}$. Diagonals $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{BD}$ intersect at $P$. If triangle $ABP$ is cut out and removed, edges $\\overline{AP}$ and $\\overline{BP}$ are joined, and the figure is then creased along segments $\\overline{CP}$ and $\\overline{DP}$, we obtain a triangular pyramid, all four of whose faces are isosceles triangles. Find the volume of this pyramid.\n[asy] pair D=origin, A=(13,0), B=(13,12), C=(0,12), P=(6.5, 6); draw(B--C--P--D--C^^D--A); filldraw(A--P--B--cycle, gray, black); label(\"$A$\", A, SE); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, NW); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$P$\", P, N); label(\"$13\\sqrt{3}$\", A--D, S); label(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\", A--B, E);[/asy]\n",

    "solution": "Let $\\triangle{ABC}$ (or the triangle with sides $12\\sqrt {3}$, $13\\sqrt {3}$, $13\\sqrt {3}$) be the base of our tetrahedron. We set points $C$ and $D$ as $(6\\sqrt {3}, 0, 0)$ and $( - 6\\sqrt {3}, 0, 0)$, respectively. Using Pythagoras, we find $A$ as $(0, \\sqrt {399}, 0)$. We know that the vertex of the tetrahedron ($P$) has to be of the form $(x, y, z)$, where $z$ is the altitude of the tetrahedron. Since the distance from $P$ to points $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $\\frac {\\sqrt {939}}{2}$, we can write three equations using the distance formula:\n\\begin{align*} x^{2} + (y - \\sqrt {399})^{2} + z^{2} &= \\frac {939}{4}\\\\ (x - 6\\sqrt {3})^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} &= \\frac {939}{4}\\\\ (x + 6\\sqrt {3})^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} &= \\frac {939}{4} \\end{align*}\nSubtracting the last two equations, we get $x = 0$. Solving for $y,z$ with a bit of effort, we eventually get $x = 0$, $y = \\frac {291}{2\\sqrt {399}}$, $z = \\frac {99}{\\sqrt {133}}$. Since the area of a triangle is $\\frac {1}{2}\\cdot bh$, we have the base area as $18\\sqrt {133}$. Thus, the volume is $V = \\frac {1}{3}\\cdot18\\sqrt {133}\\cdot\\frac {99}{\\sqrt {133}} = 6\\cdot99 = \\boxed{594}$."
