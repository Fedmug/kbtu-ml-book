    "problem": "A solid box is 15 cm by 10 cm by 8 cm. A new solid is formed by removing a cube 3 cm on a side from each corner of this box. What percent of the original volume is removed?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The total volume of the eight removed cubes is $8\\times 3^{3}=216$ cubic centimeters, and the volume of the original box is $15\\times 10\\times 8 = 1200$ cubic centimeters. Therefore the volume has been reduced by $\\left(\\frac{216}{1200}\\right)(100\\%) = \\boxed{18\\%}. $"
