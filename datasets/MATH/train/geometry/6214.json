    "problem": "A plane intersects a right circular cylinder of radius $1$ forming an ellipse. If the major axis of the ellipse of $50\\%$ longer than the minor axis, the length of the major axis is\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{3}{2}\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 2\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{9}{4}\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 3$\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "We note that we can draw the minor axis to see that because the minor axis is the minimum distance between two opposite points on the ellipse, we can draw a line through two opposite points of the cylinder, and so the minor axis is $2(1) = 2$. Therefore, our answer is $2(1.5) = \\boxed{3}$."
