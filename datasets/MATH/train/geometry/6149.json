    "problem": "Tetrahedron $ABCD$ has $AD=BC=28$, $AC=BD=44$, and $AB=CD=52$. For any point $X$ in space, suppose $f(X)=AX+BX+CX+DX$. The least possible value of $f(X)$ can be expressed as $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.\n",

    "solution": "Let $M$ and $N$ be midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$. The given conditions imply that $\\triangle ABD\\cong\\triangle BAC$ and $\\triangle CDA\\cong\\triangle DCB$, and therefore $MC=MD$ and $NA=NB$. It follows that $M$ and $N$ both lie on the common perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, and thus line $MN$ is that common perpendicular bisector. Points $B$ and $C$ are symmetric to $A$ and $D$ with respect to line $MN$. If $X$ is a point in space and $X'$ is the point symmetric to $X$ with respect to line $MN$, then $BX=AX'$ and $CX=DX'$, so $f(X) = AX+AX'+DX+DX'$.\nLet $Q$ be the intersection of $\\overline{XX'}$ and $\\overline{MN}$. Then $AX+AX'\\geq 2AQ$, from which it follows that $f(X) \\geq 2(AQ+DQ) = f(Q)$. It remains to minimize $f(Q)$ as $Q$ moves along $\\overline{MN}$.\nAllow $D$ to rotate about $\\overline{MN}$ to point $D'$ in the plane $AMN$ on the side of $\\overline{MN}$ opposite $A$. Because $\\angle DNM$ is a right angle, $D'N=DN$. It then follows that $f(Q) = 2(AQ+D'Q)\\geq 2AD'$, and equality occurs when $Q$ is the intersection of $\\overline{AD'}$ and $\\overline{MN}$. Thus $\\min f(Q) = 2AD'$. Because $\\overline{MD}$ is the median of $\\triangle ADB$, the Length of Median Formula shows that $4MD^2 = 2AD^2 + 2BD^2 - AB^2 = 2\\cdot 28^2 + 2 \\cdot 44^2 - 52^2$ and $MD^2 = 684$. By the Pythagorean Theorem $MN^2 = MD^2 - ND^2 = 8$.\nBecause $\\angle AMN$ and $\\angle D'NM$ are right angles,\\[(AD')^2 = (AM+D'N)^2 + MN^2 = (2AM)^2 + MN^2 = 52^2 + 8 = 4\\cdot 678.\\]It follows that $\\min f(Q) = 2AD' = 4\\sqrt{678}$. The requested sum is $4+678=\\boxed{682}$."
