    "solution": "Let $X$ be the intersection of the circles with centers $B$ and $E$, and $Y$ be the intersection of the circles with centers $C$ and $E$. Since the radius of $B$ is $3$, $AX =4$. Assume $AE$ = $p$. Then $EX$ and $EY$ are radii of circle $E$ and have length $4+p$. $AC = 8$, and angle $CAE = 60$ degrees because we are given that triangle $T$ is equilateral. Using the Law of Cosines on triangle $CAE$, we obtain\n$(6+p)^2 =p^2 + 64 - 2(8)(p) \\cos 60$.\nThe $2$ and the $\\cos 60$ terms cancel out:\n$p^2 + 12p +36 = p^2 + 64 - 8p$\n$12p+ 36 = 64 - 8p$\n$p =\\frac {28}{20} = \\frac {7}{5}$. The radius of circle $E$ is $4 + \\frac {7}{5} = \\frac {27}{5}$, so the answer is $27 + 5 = \\boxed{32}$."
