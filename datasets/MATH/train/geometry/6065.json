    "problem": "Let $R = (8,6)$. The lines whose equations are $8y = 15x$ and $10y = 3x$ contain points $P$ and $Q$, respectively, such that $R$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{PQ}$. The length of $PQ$ equals $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",

By the midpoint formula, we have $\\frac{a+b}2=8$ and $\\frac{15a}{16}+\\frac{3b}{20}=6$. Solving for $b$ gives $b= \\frac{80}{7}$, so the point $Q$ is $\\left(\\frac{80}7, \\frac{24}7\\right)$. The answer is twice the distance from $Q$ to $(8,6)$, which by the distance formula is $\\frac{60}{7}$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{67}$."
