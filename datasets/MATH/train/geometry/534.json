    "problem": "A right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters. The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$."
