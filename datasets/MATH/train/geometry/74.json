    "problem": "A two-inch cube ($2\\times2\\times2$) of silver weighs 3 pounds and is worth $\\$200$. How much is a three-inch cube of silver worth?  Round your answer to the nearest dollar.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of a two-inch cube is $2^3=8$ cu inches, while that of a three-inch cube is 27 cu inches. Therefore, the weight and value of the larger cube is $\\frac{27}{8}$ times that of the smaller. $\\$200(\\frac{27}{8})=\\boxed{\\$675}$."
