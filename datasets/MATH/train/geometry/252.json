    "solution": "The length of the bottom side of the parallelogram is 7 units, and the length of the left side of the parallelogram is $\\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5$ units, by the Pythagorean theorem.  Since the opposite two sides are congruent to these two, the perimeter of the parallelogram is $5+7+5+7=24$ units.  The area of the parallelogram is equal to its base times its height, which is $(7)(4)=28$ square units.  Therefore, $p+a=24+28=\\boxed{52}$."
