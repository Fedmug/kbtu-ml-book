    "solution": "Label the center of the larger circle $O$ and the points of contact between the larger circle and the smaller circles $A$ and $B.$ Draw the radius $OA$ of the larger circle.\n\n[asy]\nsize(120);\nimport graph;\nfilldraw(Circle((0,0),2),mediumgray);\nfilldraw(Circle((-1,0),1),white);\nfilldraw(Circle((1,0),1),white);\ndraw((-2,0)--(0,0));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-2,0),W); label(\"$O$\",(0,0),E); label(\"$B$\",(2,0),E);\n\n[/asy]\n\nSince the smaller circle and the larger circle touch at $A,$ the diameter through $A$ of the smaller circle lies along the diameter through $A$ of the larger circle. (This is because each diameter is perpendicular to the common tangent at the point of contact.)\n\nSince $AO$ is a radius of the larger circle, it is a diameter of the smaller circle.\n\nSince the radius of the larger circle is $6,$ the diameter of the smaller circle is $6,$ so the radius of the smaller circle on the left is $3.$\n\nSimilarly, we can draw a radius through $O$ and $B$ and deduce that the radius of the smaller circle on the right is also $3.$ The area of the shaded region equals the area of the larger circle minus the combined area of the two smaller circles. Thus, the area of the shaded region is $$6^2\\pi - 3^2\\pi - 3^2\\pi = 36\\pi - 9\\pi - 9\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}.$$"
