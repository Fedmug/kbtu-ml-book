    "problem": "What is the ratio of the numerical value of the area, in square units, of an equilateral triangle of side length 4 units to the numerical value of its perimeter, in units? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The area of this equilateral triangle is $\\frac{4^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, and the perimeter is $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$. Thus, the ratio of area to perimeter is $\\frac{\\frac{4^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$."
