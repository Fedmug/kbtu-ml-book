    "problem": "Given that the diagonals of a rhombus are always perpendicular bisectors of each other, what is the area of a rhombus with side length $\\sqrt{89}$ units and diagonals that differ by 6 units?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, they divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.  Let $x$ be half of the length of the shorter diagonal of the rhombus.  Then $x+3$ is half of the length of the longer diagonal.  Also, $x$ and $x+3$ are the lengths of the legs of each of the right triangles.  By the Pythagorean theorem,  \\[\nx^2+(x+3)^2=\\left(\\sqrt{89}\\right)^2.\n\\] Expanding $(x+3)^2$ as $x^2+6x+9$ and moving every term to the left-hand side, the equation simplifies to $2x^2+6x-80=0$.  The expression $2x^2+6x-80$ factors as $2(x-5)(x+8)$, so we find $x=5$ and $x=-8$.  Discarding the negative solution, we calculate the area of the rhombus by multiplying the area of one of the right triangles by 4. The area of the rhombus is $4\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5(5+3)\\right)=\\boxed{80}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(3mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7pt)+fontsize(11pt));\ndotfactor=3;\npair A=(8,0), B=(0,5), C=(-8,0), D=(0,-5), Ep = (0,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$x$\",midpoint(Ep--B),W);\nlabel(\"$x+3$\",midpoint(Ep--A),S);\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{89}$\",midpoint(A--B),NE);[/asy]"
