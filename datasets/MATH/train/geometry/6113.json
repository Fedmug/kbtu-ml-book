    "problem": "In right $\\triangle ABC$ with hypotenuse $\\overline{AB}$, $AC = 12$, $BC = 35$, and $\\overline{CD}$ is the altitude to $\\overline{AB}$. Let $\\omega$ be the circle having $\\overline{CD}$ as a diameter. Let $I$ be a point outside $\\triangle ABC$ such that $\\overline{AI}$ and $\\overline{BI}$ are both tangent to circle $\\omega$. The ratio of the perimeter of $\\triangle ABI$ to the length $AB$ can be expressed in the form $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",

    "solution": "Let $O$ be center of the circle and $P$,$Q$ be the two points of tangent such that $P$ is on $BI$ and $Q$ is on $AI$. We know that $AD:CD = CD:BD = 12:35$.\nSince the ratios between corresponding lengths of two similar diagrams are equal, we can let $AD = 144, CD = 420$ and $BD = 1225$. Hence $AQ = 144, BP = 1225, AB = 1369$ and the radius $r = OD = 210$.\nSince we have $\\tan OAB = \\frac {35}{24}$ and $\\tan OBA = \\frac{6}{35}$ , we have $\\sin {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {1369}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}},$$\\cos {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {630}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}}$.\nHence $\\sin I = \\sin {(2OAB + 2OBA)} = \\frac {2*1369*630}{1801*1261}$. let $IP = IQ = x$ , then we have Area$(IBC)$ = $(2x + 1225*2 + 144*2)*\\frac {210}{2}$ = $(x + 144)(x + 1225)* \\sin {\\frac {I}{2}}$. Then we get $x + 1369 = \\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261}$.\nNow the equation looks very complex but we can take a guess here. Assume that $x$ is a rational number (If it's not then the answer to the problem would be irrational which can't be in the form of $\\frac {m}{n}$) that can be expressed as $\\frac {a}{b}$ such that $(a,b) = 1$. Look at both sides; we can know that $a$ has to be a multiple of $1369$ and not of $3$ and it's reasonable to think that $b$ is divisible by $3$ so that we can cancel out the $3$ on the right side of the equation.\nLet's see if $x = \\frac {1369}{3}$ fits. Since $\\frac {1369}{3} + 1369 = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$, and $\\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261} = \\frac {3*1369* \\frac {1801}{3} * \\frac {1261*4}{3}} {1801*1261} = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$. Amazingly it fits!\nSince we know that $3*1369*144*1225 - 1369*1801*1261 < 0$, the other solution of this equation is negative which can be ignored. Hence $x = 1369/3$.\nHence the perimeter is $1225*2 + 144*2 + \\frac {1369}{3} *2 = 1369* \\frac {8}{3}$, and $BC$ is $1369$. Hence $\\frac {m}{n} = \\frac {8}{3}$, $m + n = \\boxed{11}$."
