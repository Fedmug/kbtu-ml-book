    "solution": "First, we can create a square with the points $O$ and $E$ as opposite corners. Label the other two points as $X$ and $Y$ with $X$ on $OC$ and $Y$ on $OB$. We get that $X$ is $(4,0)$ and $Y$ is $(0,4)$.\n\nWe can find the area of the figure by finding the area of the square and the two triangles created.\n\nThe area of the square is $4 \\cdot 4 =16.$\n\nThe two triangles are right triangles. The first one, $XCE$, has legs $XC$ and $XE$ of length $4$, so the area is $\\frac{4 \\cdot 4}{2}=8$.\nTo find the area of the other triangle, we must find the coordinates of $B (0,y)$. The slope of $BE$ is of slope $-2$. Therefore, $\\frac{y-4}{0-4}=-2$.\n\nSolving for $y$, we get $y=12.$ Then, the leg of the second triangle $BY$ is $12-4=8$. The area of the triangle $YEB$ is thus $\\frac{8 \\cdot 4}{2}=16.$\n\nAdding the areas of the three areas together, $16+16+8=\\boxed{40}.$"
