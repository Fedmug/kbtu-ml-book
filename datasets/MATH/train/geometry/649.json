    "problem": "What is the height of Jack's house, in feet, if the house casts a shadow 56 feet long at the same time a 21-foot tree casts a shadow that is 24 feet long? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The ratio of shadow lengths is $\\frac{56}{24}=\\frac{7}{3}$.\n\nThis is the same as the ratio of actual heights, so if $h$ is the height of the house,\n\n$$\\frac{h}{21}=\\frac{7}{3}\\Rightarrow h=\\boxed{49}$$"
