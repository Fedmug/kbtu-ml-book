Let the radius of $\\odot Q$ be $r$. We know that $PQ = r + 16$. From $Q$ draw segment $\\overline{QM} \\parallel \\overline{BC}$ such that $M$ is on $PX$. Clearly, $QM = XY$ and $PM = 16-r$. Also, we know $QPM$ is a right triangle.\nTo find $XC$, consider the right triangle $PCX$. Since $\\odot P$ is tangent to $\\overline{AC},\\overline{BC}$, then $PC$ bisects $\\angle ACB$. Let $\\angle ACB = 2\\theta$; then $\\angle PCX = \\angle QBX = \\theta$. Dropping the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, we recognize the $7 - 24 - 25$ right triangle, except scaled by $4$.\nSo we get that $\\tan(2\\theta) = 24/7$. From the half-angle identity, we find that $\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac {3}{4}$. Therefore, $XC = \\frac {64}{3}$. By similar reasoning in triangle $QBY$, we see that $BY = \\frac {4r}{3}$.\nWe conclude that $XY = 56 - \\frac {4r + 64}{3} = \\frac {104 - 4r}{3}$.\nSo our right triangle $QPM$ has sides $r + 16$, $r - 16$, and $\\frac {104 - 4r}{3}$.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, simplification, and the quadratic formula, we can get $r = 44 - 6\\sqrt {35}$, for a final answer of $\\boxed{254}$."
