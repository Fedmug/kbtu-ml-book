    "problem": "A rectangular prism has dimensions 8 inches by 2 inches by 32 inches. If a cube has the same volume as the prism, what is the surface area of the cube, in square inches?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The cube has volume $8\\cdot2\\cdot32$ cubic inches, so its edge length is $\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot2\\cdot32}=\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot64}=\\sqrt[3]{8}\\sqrt[3]{64}=2\\cdot4=8$ inches.  The surface area of a cube with edge length 8 inches is $6(8\\text{ in.})^2=\\boxed{384}$ square inches."
