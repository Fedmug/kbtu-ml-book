    "problem": "When the height of a cylinder is doubled and its radius is increased by $200\\%$, the cylinder's volume is multiplied by a factor of $X$. What is the value of $X$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The cylinder's original volume is $\\pi r^2h$. The new height is $2h$ and the new radius is $r+\\frac{200}{100}r=3r$. That means the new volume is $\\pi (3r)^2(2h)=\\pi r^2h(9)(2)$. The new volume is the original volume multiplied by a factor of $\\boxed{18}$."
