    "problem": "Let $\\triangle PQR$ be a triangle in the plane, and let $S$ be a point outside the plane of $\\triangle PQR$, so that $SPQR$ is a pyramid whose faces are all triangles.\n\nSuppose that every edge of $SPQR$ has length $18$ or $41$, but no face of $SPQR$ is equilateral. Then what is the surface area of $SPQR$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since all edges of pyramid $SPQR$ have length $18$ or $41$, each triangular face must be isosceles: either $18$-$18$-$41$ or $18$-$41$-$41$. But the first of these two sets of side lengths violates the triangle inequality, since $18+18<41$. Therefore, every face of $SPQR$ must have sides of lengths $18,$ $41,$ and $41$.\n\nTo find the area of each face, we draw an $18$-$41$-$41$ triangle with altitude $h$: [asy]\nsize(4cm);\npair a=(0,40); pair b=(-9,0); pair c=(9,0); pair o=(0,0);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); draw(a--b--c--a); draw(a--o,dashed); draw(rightanglemark(a,o,c,60));\nlabel(\"$h$\",(a+2*o)/3,SE);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+c)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+c)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+b)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+b)/2,N);\n[/asy] Since the triangle is isosceles, we know the altitude bisects the base (as marked above). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $9^2+h^2=41^2$ and thus $h=40$. So, the triangle has area $\\frac 12\\cdot 18\\cdot 40 = 360$.\n\nThe surface area of pyramid $SPQR$ is made up of four such triangles, so it amounts to $4\\cdot 360 = \\boxed{1440}$.\n\n${\\bf Remark.}$  One might wonder whether a pyramid with the properties enumerated in the problem actually exists. The answer is yes! To form such a pyramid, imagine attaching two $18$-$41$-$41$ triangles (like that in the diagram) along their short edges, so that the triangles are free to rotate around that hinge: [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple a=(9,0,0); triple b=-a; triple c=(0,sqrt(1519),-9); triple d=(0,sqrt(1519),9);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); dot(d);\ndraw(surface(a--b--c--cycle),orange,nolight);\ndraw(b--c--a);\ndraw(surface(a--b--d--cycle),yellow,nolight);\ndraw(b--d--a--b);\ndraw(c--d,dashed);\n[/asy] Now you can adjust the distance between the two \"free\" vertices (the dotted line in the diagram above) so that it is $18$. Adding that edge to the diagram and filling in, we have a pyramid with the desired properties."
