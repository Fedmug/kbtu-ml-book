    "problem": "Circle $A$ is in the interior of circle $B$. The diameter of circle $B$ is 16 cm.

    "solution": "Since the ratio of the area of $A$ to the shaded area inside $B$ is $1:3$, the ratio of the area of $A$ to the entire area of $B$ is $1:(3+1) = 1:4$.  Since the area of $B$ is 4 times the area of $A$, the radius of $B$ is twice the radius of $A$, which means the diameter of $A$ is half the diameter of $B$, or $\\boxed{8\\text{ cm}}$."
