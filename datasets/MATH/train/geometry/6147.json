    "problem": "Centered at each lattice point in the coordinate plane are a circle radius $\\frac{1}{10}$ and a square with sides of length $\\frac{1}{5}$ whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. The line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(1001, 429)$ intersects $m$ of the squares and $n$ of the circles. Find $m + n$.\n",

    "solution": "First note that $1001 = 143 \\cdot 7$ and $429 = 143 \\cdot 3$ so every point of the form $(7k, 3k)$ is on the line. Then consider the line $l$ from $(7k, 3k)$ to $(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))$. Translate the line $l$ so that $(7k, 3k)$ is now the origin. There is one square and one circle that intersect the line around $(0,0)$. Then the points on $l$ with an integral $x$-coordinate are, since $l$ has the equation $y = \\frac{3x}{7}$:\n\\[(0,0), \\left(1, \\frac{3}{7}\\right), \\left(2, \\frac{6}{7}\\right), \\left(3, 1 + \\frac{2}{7}\\right), \\left(4, 1 + \\frac{5}{7}\\right), \\left(5, 2 + \\frac{1}{7}\\right), \\left(6, 2 + \\frac{4}{7}\\right), (7,3).\\]\nWe claim that the lower right vertex of the square centered at $(2,1)$ lies on $l$. Since the square has side length $\\frac{1}{5}$, the lower right vertex of this square has coordinates $\\left(2 + \\frac{1}{10},  1 - \\frac{1}{10}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{21}{10}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$. Because $\\frac{9}{10} = \\frac{3}{7} \\cdot \\frac{21}{10}$, $\\left(\\frac{21}{10}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$ lies on $l$. Since the circle centered at $(2,1)$ is contained inside the square, this circle does not intersect $l$. Similarly the upper left vertex of the square centered at $(5,2)$ is on $l$. Since every other point listed above is farther away from a lattice point (excluding (0,0) and (7,3)) and there are two squares with centers strictly between $(0,0)$ and $(7,3)$ that intersect $l$. Since there are $\\frac{1001}{7} = \\frac{429}{3} = 143$ segments from $(7k, 3k)$ to $(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))$, the above count is yields $143 \\cdot 2 = 286$ squares. Since every lattice point on $l$ is of the form $(3k, 7k)$ where $0 \\le k \\le 143$, there are $144$ lattice points on $l$. Centered at each lattice point, there is one square and one circle, hence this counts $288$ squares and circles. Thus $m + n = 286 + 288 = \\boxed{574}$."
