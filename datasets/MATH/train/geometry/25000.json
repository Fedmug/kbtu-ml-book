    "problem": "Consider the set of points that are inside or within one unit of a rectangular parallelepiped (box) that measures 3 by 4 by 5 units. Given that the volume of this set is $\\displaystyle {{m+n\\pi}\\over\np}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, and $n$ and $p$ are relatively prime, find $m+n+p$.",

    "solution": "First consider the points in the six parallelepipeds projecting 1 unit outward from the original parallelepiped. Two of these six parallelepipeds are 1 by 3 by 4, two are 1 by 3 by 5, and two are 1 by 4 by 5. The sum of their volumes is $2(1\\cdot3\\cdot4+1\\cdot3\\cdot5+1\\cdot4\\cdot5)=94$. Next consider the points in the twelve quarter-cylinders of radius 1 whose heights are the edges of the original parallelepiped. The sum of their volumes is $4\\cdot{1\\over4}\\pi\\cdot1^2(3+4+5)=12\\pi$. Finally, consider the points in the eight octants of a sphere of radius 1 at the eight vertices of the original parallelepiped. The sum of their volumes is $8\\cdot{1\\over8}\\cdot{4\\over3}\\pi\\cdot1^3={{4\\pi}\\over3}$. Because the volume of the original parallelepiped is $3\\cdot4\\cdot 5=60$, the requested volume is $60+94+12\\pi+4\\pi/3=\\displaystyle\n{{462+40\\pi}\\over3}$, so $m+n+p=462+40+3=\\boxed{505}$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(250);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12)--(12,14)--(12,2)--cycle);\nfill((2,1)--(14,3)--(14,11)--(2,9)--cycle,white);\ndraw((2,1)--(14,3)--(14,11)--(2,9)--cycle);\ndraw((-3,9.5)--(13.2,12.2));\ndraw((12,12)--(14,11));\ndraw((0,10)--(2,9));\ndraw((0,2)--(2,1));\ndraw((-1.8,1.7)--(0,2));\ndraw((12,12.8)--(13.2,12.2)--(13.2,11.4));\ndraw((-1.8,1.7)--(-1.8,9.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(-8,4)--(-8,16)--(0,12));\nfill((-1.8,1.7)--(-9.8,5.7)--(-9.8,13.7)--(-1.8,9.7)--cycle,white);\ndraw((-1.8,1.7)--(-9.8,5.7)--(-9.8,13.7)--(-1.8,9.7)--cycle);\ndraw((2,9)--(-9,14.5));\ndraw((0,12)--(12,14)--(4,18)--(-8,16)--cycle);\ndraw((-1.8,9.7)--(0,10));\ndraw((-9.8,13.7)--(-8,14));\ndraw((-9,14.5)--(-8,14.7));\ndraw((-9,14.5)--(-9,13.9));\nfill((-1.8,9.7)--(0,10)--(-8,14)--(-9.8,13.7)--cycle,white);\nfill((0,10)--(2,9)--(14,11)--(12,12)--cycle,white);\ndraw((-1.8,9.7)--(0,10)--(-8,14)--(-9.8,13.7)--cycle);\ndraw((0,10)--(2,9)--(14,11)--(12,12)--cycle);\n\n[/asy]"
