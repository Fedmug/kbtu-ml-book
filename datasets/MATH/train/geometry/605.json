    "problem": "A regular polygon has exterior angles each measuring 15 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The measure of each exterior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $360/n$ degrees.  Setting this expression equal to 15, we find $n=\\boxed{24}$."
