    "problem": "The sides of rectangle $ABCD$ have lengths $10$ and $11$. An equilateral triangle is drawn so that no point of the triangle lies outside $ABCD$. The maximum possible area of such a triangle can be written in the form $p\\sqrt{q}-r$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are positive integers, and $q$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number. Find $p+q+r$.\n",

    "solution": "Since $\\angle{BAD}=90$ and $\\angle{EAF}=60$, it follows that $\\angle{DAF}+\\angle{BAE}=90-60=30$. Rotate triangle $ADF$ $60$ degrees clockwise. Note that the image of $AF$ is $AE$. Let the image of $D$ be $D'$. Since angles are preserved under rotation, $\\angle{DAF}=\\angle{D'AE}$. It follows that $\\angle{D'AE}+\\angle{BAE}=\\angle{D'AB}=30$. Since $\\angle{ADF}=\\angle{ABE}=90$, it follows that quadrilateral $ABED'$ is cyclic with circumdiameter $AE=s$ and thus circumradius $\\frac{s}{2}$. Let $O$ be its circumcenter. By Inscribed Angles, $\\angle{BOD'}=2\\angle{BAD}=60$. By the definition of circle, $OB=OD'$. It follows that triangle $OBD'$ is equilateral. Therefore, $BD'=r=\\frac{s}{2}$. Applying the Law of Cosines to triangle $ABD'$, $\\frac{s}{2}=\\sqrt{10^2+11^2-(2)(10)(11)(\\cos{30})}$. Squaring and multiplying by $\\sqrt{3}$ yields $\\frac{s^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}=221\\sqrt{3}-330\\implies{p+q+r=221+3+330=\\boxed{554}}$"
