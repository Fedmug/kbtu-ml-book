    "problem": "A delicious circular pie with diameter $12\\text{ cm}$ is cut into three equal-sized sector-shaped pieces. Let $l$ be the number of centimeters in the length of the longest line segment that may be drawn in one of these pieces. What is $l^2$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "First of all, let us draw one of these pieces in question, labeling points of interest as necessary: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO;\npO = (0, 0);\npA = dir(150);\npB = dir(30);\npC = dir(90);\ndraw(pA--pO--pB);\ndraw(pA..pC..pB);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, W);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, E);\nlabel(\"$O$\", pO, S);\n[/asy] We can see that the longest segment we can draw is from $A$ to $B,$ and to find $AB,$ we should create right triangles by drawing the perpendicular bisector to $AB.$ [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pM, pO;\npO = (0, 0);\npA = dir(150);\npB = dir(30);\npC = dir(90);\npM = 0.5 * pA + 0.5 * pB;\ndraw(pA--pO--pB);\ndraw(pA--pB);\ndraw(pM--pO);\ndraw(pA..pC..pB);\ndraw(rightanglemark(pO,pM,pA,2));\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, W);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, E);\nlabel(\"$O$\", pO, S);\nlabel(\"$M$\", pM, N);\n[/asy] Since $\\angle MOB$ is half of $\\angle AOB,$ which is a third of a full circle, we have $\\angle MOB = 60^\\circ,$ so $\\triangle MOB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle. Since the diameter of the pie is $12\\text{ cm},$ we see that $OB = 6\\text{ cm},$ so $MO = 3\\text{ cm}$ and $MB = 3\\sqrt{3}\\text{ cm}.$ Then, $AB = 2 \\cdot MB = 6\\sqrt{3}\\text{ cm},$ so $l = 6\\sqrt{3}.$ Finally, $l^2 = \\boxed{108}.$"
