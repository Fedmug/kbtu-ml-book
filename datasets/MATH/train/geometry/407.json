    "problem": "Circle $T$ has its center at point $T(-2,6)$. Circle $T$ is reflected across the $y$-axis and then translated 8 units down. What are the coordinates of the image of the center of circle $T$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Since the image is reflected across the $y$-axis first, we will just change the sign of the $x$-coordinate, which will give us $(2, 6)$. Next the image is shifted down 8 units so we will subtract 8 from the $y$-coordinate, giving our image a final center of $\\boxed{(2, -2)}$."
