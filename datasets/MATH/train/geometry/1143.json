    "problem": "The interior of a right, circular cone is 8 inches tall with a 2-inch radius at the opening. The interior of the cone is filled with ice cream, and the cone has a hemisphere of ice cream exactly covering the opening of the cone. What is the volume of ice cream? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The volume of the cone is $\\frac13\\cdot4\\pi\\cdot8=\\frac{32}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches, and the volume of the hemisphere is $\\frac23\\cdot8\\pi=\\frac{16}{3}\\pi$. The sum is \\[\n\\left(\\frac{16}{3}+\\frac{32}{3}\\right)\\pi=\\boxed{16\\pi}.\n\\]"
