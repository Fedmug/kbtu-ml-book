    "problem": "A park is in the shape of a regular hexagon $2$ km on a side. Starting at a corner, Alice walks along the perimeter of the park for a distance of $5$ km. How many kilometers is she from her starting point?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\sqrt{13}\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{14}\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\sqrt{15}\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\sqrt{16}\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\sqrt{17}$\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "We imagine this problem on a coordinate plane and let Alice's starting position be the origin. We see that she will travel along two edges and then go halfway along a third. Therefore, her new $x$-coordinate will be $1 + 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ because she travels along a distance of $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1$ km because of the side relationships of an equilateral triangle, then $2$ km because the line is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the remaining distance is $\\frac{1}{2}$ km because she went halfway along and because of the logic for the first part of her route. For her $y$-coordinate, we can use similar logic to find that the coordinate is $\\sqrt{3} + 0 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} =  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, her distance is\\[\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{52}{4}} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}\\]"
