    "problem": "Points $(1,-5)$ and $(11,7)$ are the opposite vertices of a parallelogram.  What are the coordinates of the point where the diagonals of the parallelogram intersect?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at the midpoint of each diagonal. So, we simply find the midpoint of $(1,-5)$ and $(11,7)$, which is $\\left(\\frac{1+11}{2}, \\frac{-5+7}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{(6,1)}$."
