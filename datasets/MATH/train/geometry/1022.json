    "problem": "The center of a circle has coordinates $(6,-5)$. The circle is reflected about the line $y=x$. What are the $x,y$ coordinates of the center of the image circle? State the $x$ coordinate first.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The center of the image circle is simply the center of the original circle reflected over the line $y=x$. When reflecting over this line, we swap the $x$ and $y$ coordinates. Thus, the image center is the point $\\boxed{(-5, 6)}$."
