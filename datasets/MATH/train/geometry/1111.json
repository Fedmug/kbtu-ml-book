    "solution": "We begin by drawing a diagram: [asy]\nsize(5cm);\npair a=(0,1); pair b=(1,1); pair c=(1,0); pair d=(0,0); pair e=(1,.82); pair f=(a+e)/2; pair g=(d+e)/2;\nfill(b--e--g--f--cycle,gray);\nfill(g--c--d--cycle,pink);\ndot(a);dot(b);dot(c);dot(d);dot(e);dot(f);dot(g);\ndraw(a--b--c--d--a);\ndraw(a--e--d);\ndraw(e--g--f--b);\ndraw(g--c);\nlabel(\"$A$\",a,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",b,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",c,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",d,SW);\nlabel(\"$E$\",e,E);\nlabel(\"$F$\",f,SW);\nlabel(\"$G$\",g,NW);\n[/asy] We know that the gray area above (quadrilateral $BEGF$) has area $34$, and we wish to determine the pink area ($\\triangle GCD$).\n\nFirst we note that $\\triangle AED$ has base $AD$, equal to the side length of square $ABCD$, and also has height equal to the side length of square $ABCD$. Thus $\\triangle AED$ has area equal to half the area of $ABCD$, or $100$.\n\nTriangle $\\triangle FEG$ has half the base and half the height of $\\triangle AED$, so its area is $\\frac12\\cdot\\frac 12\\cdot 100 = 25$.\n\nSince quadrilateral $BEGF$ can be divided into $\\triangle FEG$ and $\\triangle FBE$, we know that $\\triangle FBE$ has area $34-25=9$. This is half the area of $\\triangle ABE$ (which shares an altitude with $\\triangle FBE$ and has twice the corresponding base). Thus, $\\triangle ABE$ has area $18$.\n\nSince square $ABCD$ can be divided into triangles $ABE$, $AED$, and $ECD$, we know that the area of $\\triangle ECD$ is $200-100-18 = 82$. Finally, $\\triangle GCD$ shares an altitude with $\\triangle ECD$ and has half the corresponding base, so the area of $\\triangle GCD$ is $\\frac 12\\cdot 82$, or $\\boxed{41}$."
