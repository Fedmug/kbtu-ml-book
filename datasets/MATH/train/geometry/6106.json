    "problem": "Let $ABCD$ be an isosceles trapezoid with $\\overline{AD}||\\overline{BC}$ whose angle at the longer base $\\overline{AD}$ is $\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$. The diagonals have length $10\\sqrt {21}$, and point $E$ is at distances $10\\sqrt {7}$ and $30\\sqrt {7}$ from vertices $A$ and $D$, respectively. Let $F$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $\\overline{AD}$. The distance $EF$ can be expressed in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n",

However, if $AD$ is strictly greater than $20\\sqrt {7}$, then the circle with radius $10\\sqrt {21}$ and center $A$ does not touch $DC$, which implies that $AC > 10\\sqrt {21}$, a contradiction. As a result, A, D, and E are collinear. Therefore, $AD = 20\\sqrt {7}$.\nThus, $ADC$ and $ACF$ are $30-60-90$ triangles. Hence $AF = 15\\sqrt {7}$, and\n$EF = EA + AF = 10\\sqrt {7} + 15\\sqrt {7} = 25\\sqrt {7}$\nFinally, the answer is $25+7=\\boxed{32}$."
