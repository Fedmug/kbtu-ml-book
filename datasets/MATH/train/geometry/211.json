    "problem": "The volume of a cylinder is $54\\pi$ $\\text{cm}^3$. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone with the same radius and height as the cylinder? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. [asy]\nimport solids; currentprojection=orthographic(0,100,25); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nrevolution cyl = cylinder((5,0,0),1,5,Z);\nrevolution cone = cone((0,0,0),1,5,Z);\ndraw(cyl,backpen=dashed);\ndraw(cone,backpen=dashed);\n\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $(1/3)\\pi r^2 h$; a cylinder with the same radius and height has volume $\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus we see the volume of the corresponding cone has 1/3 the volume of the cylinder, which is $(1/3)(54\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}$ cubic cm."
