    "problem": "$ABCD$ is a trapezoid with the measure of base $\\overline{AB}$ twice the measure of the base $\\overline{CD}$. Point $E$ is the point of intersection of the diagonals. The measure of diagonal $\\overline{AC}$ is 11. Find the length of segment $\\overline{EC}$. Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(200);\npair p1,p2,p3,p4;\np1 = (0,0); p2 = (2.5, 4); p3 = (7.5,4); p4 = (10,0);\n\ndraw(p1--p2--p3--p4--cycle);\ndraw(p1--p3); draw(p2--p4);\nlabel(\"$A$\", p1, SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\", p2, NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", p3, NE);\nlabel(\"$B$\", p4, SE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", (5,2.5) , S);\n\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "Since the bases of the trapezoid are $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, these two line segments must be parallel. Now, since $\\overline{AC}$ intersects these two parallel lines, $\\angle DCE$ and $\\angle BAE$ are alternate interior angles and therefore must be congruent. Similarly, $\\overline{DB}$ intersects the bases, so $\\angle CDE$ and $\\angle ABE$ are congruent. We have two pairs of congruent angles, so $\\triangle DCE \\sim \\triangle BAE$ by the Angle-Angle Similarity Theorem.\n\nSides of similar triangles are proportional, so since the lengths of sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are related in a $2:1$ proportion, we also have that $EA/EC=2/1$, so the length of $\\overline{EC}$ must be $1/3$ that of $\\overline{AC}$. Since $\\overline{AC}$ has length $11$, $\\overline{EC}$ must have length $\\dfrac{1}{3} \\cdot 11 = \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{3}}$."
