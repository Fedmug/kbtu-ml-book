    "problem": "Square $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle. Square $EFGH$ has vertices $E$ and $F$ on $\\overline{CD}$ and vertices $G$ and $H$ on the circle. If the area of square $ABCD$ is $1$, then the area of square $EFGH$ can be expressed as $\\frac {m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m < n$. Find $10n + m$.\n",

    "solution": "Let $O$ be the center of the circle, and $2a$ be the side length of $ABCD$, $2b$ be the side length of $EFGH$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the radius of $\\odot O = OC = a\\sqrt{2}$.\n[asy] size(150); pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pen d = linetype(\"4 4\") + blue + linewidth(0.7); pair C=(1,1), D=(1,-1), B=(-1,1), A=(-1,-1), E= (1, -0.2), F=(1, 0.2), G=(1.4, 0.2), H=(1.4, -0.2); D(MP(\"A\",A)--MP(\"B\",B,N)--MP(\"C\",C,N)--MP(\"D\",D)--cycle); D(MP(\"E\",E,SW)--MP(\"F\",F,NW)--MP(\"G\",G,NE)--MP(\"H\",H,SE)--cycle); D(CP(D(MP(\"O\",(0,0))), A));  D((0,0) -- (2^.5, 0), d); D((0,0) -- G -- (G.x,0), d);  [/asy]\nNow consider right triangle $OGI$, where $I$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{GH}$. Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem,\n\\begin{align*} OG^2 = 2a^2 &= OI^2 + GI^2 = (a+2b)^2 + b^2 \\\\ 0 &= a^2 - 4ab - 5b^2 = (a - 5b)(a + b) \\end{align*}\nThus $a = 5b$ (since lengths are positive, we discard the other root). The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths, so $\\frac{[EFGH]}{[ABCD]} = \\left(\\frac 15\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{25}$, and the answer is $10n + m = \\boxed{251}$.\nAnother way to proceed from $0 = a^2 - 4ab - 5b^2$ is to note that $\\frac{b}{a}$ is the quantity we need; thus, we divide by $a^2$ to get\n\\[0 = 1 - 4\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) - 5\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^2\\]This is a quadratic in $\\frac{b}{a}$, and solving it gives $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{5},-1$. The negative solution is extraneous, and so the ratio of the areas is $\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{25}$ and the answer is $10\\cdot 25 + 1 = \\boxed{251}$."
