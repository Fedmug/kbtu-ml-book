Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that $h^2 = y^2 - 6^2$ and $h^2 = x^2 - 15^2$. Thus, $y^2 - 36 = x^2 - 225 \\Longrightarrow x^2 - y^2 = 189$. The LHS is difference of squares, so $(x + y)(x - y) = 189$. As both $x,\\ y$ are integers, $x+y,\\ x-y$ must be integral divisors of $189$.\nThe pairs of divisors of $189$ are $(1,189)\\ (3,63)\\ (7,27)\\ (9,21)$. This yields the four potential sets for $(x,y)$ as $(95,94)\\ (33,30)\\ (17,10)\\ (15,6)$. The last is not a possibility since it simply degenerates into a line. The sum of the three possible perimeters of $\\triangle ACD$ is equal to $3(AC) + 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) = 90 + 2(95 + 33 + 17) = \\boxed{380}$."
