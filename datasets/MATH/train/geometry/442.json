    "problem": "Points $P$ and $R$ are located at (2, 1) and (12, 15) respectively. Point $M$ is the midpoint of segment $\\overline{PR}$. Segment $\\overline{PR}$ is reflected over the $x$-axis. What is the sum of the coordinates of the image of point $M$ (the midpoint of the reflected segment)?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Point $M$ has coordinates $(7,8)$. Therefore, its image has coordinates $(7,-8)$. Thus the sum is $7-8 = \\boxed{-1}$.\n\nAlternatively, the image of point $M$ is the midpoint of the images of points $P$ and $R$ and thus is the midpoint of $(2,-1)$ and $(12,-15)$, which is also $(7,-8)$."
