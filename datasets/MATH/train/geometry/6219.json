    "problem": "In a triangle, the area is numerically equal to the perimeter. What is the radius of the inscribed circle?\n$\\text{(A) } 2\\quad \\text{(B) } 3\\quad \\text{(C) } 4\\quad \\text{(D) } 5\\quad \\text{(E) } 6$\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "One of the most common formulas involving the inradius of a triangle is $A = rs$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle, $r$ is the inradius, and $s$ is the semiperimeter.\nThe problem states that $A = p = 2s$. This means $2s = rs$, or $r = \\boxed{2}$"
