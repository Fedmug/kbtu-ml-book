    "solution": "The water in the tank fills a cone, which we will refer to as the water cone, that is similar to the cone-shaped tank itself.  Let the scale factor between the water cone and tank be $x$, so the height of the water cone is $96x$ feet and the radius of the water cone is $16x$ feet.  It follows that the volume of the water cone is $(1/3)\\pi(16x)^2(96x)$ cubic feet.\n\nThe volume of the cone-shaped tank is $(1/3)\\pi(16^2)(96)$.  Since the water cone has $25\\%$ or 1/4 of the volume of the tank, we have  \\[(1/3)\\pi(16x)^2(96x) = (1/4) (1/3)\\pi(16^2)(96).\\]  Simplifying yields $x^3 = 1/4$, so $x = \\sqrt[3]{1/4}$.\n\nFinally, the height of the water in the tank is the height of the water cone, which is  \\[96x=96\\sqrt[3]{1/4}=48\\cdot 2\\sqrt[3]{1/4}=48\\sqrt[3]{(1/4)(8)}={48\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\] feet.  Therefore, we have $a+b=48+2 = \\boxed{50}$."
