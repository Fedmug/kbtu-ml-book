    "problem": "Piravena must make a trip from $A$ to $B$, then from $B$ to $C$, then from $C$ to $A$.  Each of these three parts of the trip is made entirely by bus or entirely by airplane.  The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of 3000 km from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of 3250 km from $A$. To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\\$100$ booking fee, plus $\\$0.10$ per kilometer.

    "solution": "Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right-angled triangle, then we may use the Pythagorean Theorem to find $BC$.\nThus, $AB^2=BC^2+CA^2$, and so  \\begin{align*}\nBC^2&=AB^2-CA^2\\\\\n&=3250^2-3000^2\\\\\n&=250^2(13^2-12^2)\\\\\n&=250^2(5^2)\\\\\n&=1250^2.\n\\end{align*}therefore $BC=1250$ km (since $BC>0$).\n\nTo fly from $A$ to $B$, the cost is $3250\\times0.10+100=\\$425$.  To bus from $A$ to $B$, the cost is $3250\\times0.15=\\$487.50$.  Since Piravena chooses the least expensive way to travel, she will fly from $A$ to $B$.\n\nTo fly from $B$ to $C$, the cost is $1250\\times0.10+100=\\$225$. To bus from $B$ to $C$, the cost is $1250\\times0.15=\\$187.50$. Since Piravena chooses the least expensive way to travel, she will bus from $B$ to $C$.\n\nTo fly from $C$ to $A$, the cost is $3000\\times0.10+100=\\$400$.  To bus from $C$ to $A$, the cost is $3000\\times0.15=\\$450$.  Since Piravena chooses the least expensive way to travel, she will fly from $C$ to $A$.\n\nThe total cost of the trip would be $\\$425+\\$187.50+\\$400=\\boxed{\\$1012.50}$."
