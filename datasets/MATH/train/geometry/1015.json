Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFB$ is a right triangle.  The perimeter of the base of the pyramid is 24 inches, so the length of each side of the base is $6$ inches.  Since $F$ is the center of the base, $FB$ is half the diagonal of the base, or $(6\\sqrt{2})/2 = 3\\sqrt{2}$ inches.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $PFB$ gives  \\[PF = \\sqrt{PB^2 - FB^2} = \\sqrt{81 - 18} = \\sqrt{63} = \\boxed{3\\sqrt{7}} \\text{ inches}.\\]"
