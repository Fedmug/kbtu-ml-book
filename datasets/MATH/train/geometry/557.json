Thus we have \\[2\\pi r = 30\\pi\\]and \\[r^2+h^2=18^2\\]From the first equation we have $r=15$; from the second equation we have $h=\\sqrt{18^2-15^2}=\\sqrt{99}=3\\sqrt{11}$.\n\nFinally, the desired volume is \\[\\frac{1}{3}r^2h\\pi = \\frac{1}{3}(15^2)(3\\sqrt{11})\\pi = {225\\pi\\sqrt{11}}.\\]So, dividing the volume by $\\pi$ gives $\\boxed{225\\sqrt{11}}$."
