    "problem": "A right triangle with legs $10$ and $8$ is similar to another right triangle with corresponding legs $x$ and $5$, respectively. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "By similarity, we know that $\\frac{10}{x} = \\frac{8}{5}$, so therefore $x = \\frac{50}{8} = \\boxed{6.25}$."
