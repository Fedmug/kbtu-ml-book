    "solution": "Diameters $PQ$ and $RS$ cross at the center of the circle, which we call $O$.\n\nThe area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of $\\triangle POS$ and $\\triangle ROQ$ plus the sum of the areas of sectors $POR$ and $SOQ$.\n\nEach of $\\triangle POS$ and $\\triangle ROQ$ is right-angled and has its two perpendicular sides of length 4 (the radius of the circle).\n\nTherefore, the area of each of these triangles is $\\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)=8$.\n\nEach of sector $POR$ and sector $SOQ$ has area $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the total area of the circle, as each has central angle $90^\\circ$ (that is, $\\angle POR = \\angle SOQ = 90^\\circ$) and $90^\\circ$ is one-quarter of the total central angle.\n\nTherefore, each sector has area $\\frac{1}{4}(\\pi(4^2))=\\frac{1}{4}(16\\pi)=4\\pi$.\n\nThus, the total shaded area is $2(8)+2(4\\pi)=\\boxed{16+8\\pi}$."
