    "problem": "A convex polyhedron $P$ has $26$ vertices, $60$ edges, and $36$ faces, $24$ of which are triangular and $12$ of which are quadrilaterals. A space diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices that do not belong to the same face. How many space diagonals does $P$ have?\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Every pair of vertices of the polyhedron determines either an edge, a face diagonal or a space diagonal. We have ${26 \\choose 2} = \\frac{26\\cdot25}2 = 325$ total line segments determined by the vertices. Of these, $60$ are edges. Each triangular face has $0$ face diagonals and each quadrilateral face has $2$, so there are $2 \\cdot 12 = 24$ face diagonals. This leaves $325 - 60 - 24 = \\boxed{241}$ segments to be the space diagonals."
