    "problem": "An equilateral triangle is inscribed in the ellipse whose equation is $x^2+4y^2=4$. One vertex of the triangle is $(0,1)$, one altitude is contained in the y-axis, and the square of the length of each side is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n",

Our answer is\\[BC = 2*\\frac {8\\sqrt {3}}{13}=\\sqrt {4\\left(\\frac {8\\sqrt {3}}{13}\\right)^{2}} = \\sqrt {\\frac {768}{169}}\\implies m + n = \\boxed{937}.\\]"
