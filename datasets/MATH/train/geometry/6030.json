    "problem": "Given a point $P$ on a triangular piece of paper $ABC,\\,$ consider the creases that are formed in the paper when $A, B,\\,$ and $C\\,$ are folded onto $P.\\,$ Let us call $P$ a fold point of $\\triangle ABC\\,$ if these creases, which number three unless $P$ is one of the vertices, do not intersect. Suppose that $AB=36, AC=72,\\,$ and $\\angle B=90^\\circ.\\,$ Then the area of the set of all fold points of $\\triangle ABC\\,$ can be written in the form $q\\pi-r\\sqrt{s},\\,$ where $q, r,\\,$ and $s\\,$ are positive integers and $s\\,$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. What is $q+r+s\\,$?\n",

    "solution": "Let $O_{AB}$ be the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors (in other words, the intersections of the creases) of $\\overline{PA}$ and $\\overline{PB}$, and so forth. Then $O_{AB}, O_{BC}, O_{CA}$ are, respectively, the circumcenters of $\\triangle PAB, PBC, PCA$. According to the problem statement, the circumcenters of the triangles cannot lie within the interior of the respective triangles, since they are not on the paper. It follows that $\\angle APB, \\angle BPC, \\angle CPA > 90^{\\circ}$; the locus of each of the respective conditions for $P$ is the region inside the (semi)circles with diameters $\\overline{AB}, \\overline{BC}, \\overline{CA}$.\nWe note that the circle with diameter $AC$ covers the entire triangle because it is the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$, so it suffices to take the intersection of the circles about $AB, BC$. We note that their intersection lies entirely within $\\triangle ABC$ (the chord connecting the endpoints of the region is in fact the altitude of $\\triangle ABC$ from $B$). Thus, the area of the locus of $P$ (shaded region below) is simply the sum of two segments of the circles. If we construct the midpoints of $M_1, M_2 = \\overline{AB}, \\overline{BC}$ and note that $\\triangle M_1BM_2 \\sim \\triangle ABC$, we see that thse segments respectively cut a $120^{\\circ}$ arc in the circle with radius $18$ and $60^{\\circ}$ arc in the circle with radius $18\\sqrt{3}$.\n[asy] pair project(pair X, pair Y, real r){return X+r*(Y-X);} path endptproject(pair X, pair Y, real a, real b){return project(X,Y,a)--project(X,Y,b);}  pathpen = linewidth(1); size(250); pen dots = linetype(\"2 3\") + linewidth(0.7), dashes = linetype(\"8 6\")+linewidth(0.7)+blue, bluedots = linetype(\"1 4\") + linewidth(0.7) + blue; pair B = (0,0), A=(36,0), C=(0,36*3^.5), P=D(MP(\"P\",(6,25), NE)), F = D(foot(B,A,C)); D(D(MP(\"A\",A)) -- D(MP(\"B\",B)) -- D(MP(\"C\",C,N)) -- cycle); fill(arc((A+B)/2,18,60,180) -- arc((B+C)/2,18*3^.5,-90,-30) -- cycle, rgb(0.8,0.8,0.8)); D(arc((A+B)/2,18,0,180),dots); D(arc((B+C)/2,18*3^.5,-90,90),dots); D(arc((A+C)/2,36,120,300),dots); D(B--F,dots); D(D((B+C)/2)--F--D((A+B)/2),dots); D(C--P--B,dashes);D(P--A,dashes);  pair Fa = bisectorpoint(P,A), Fb = bisectorpoint(P,B), Fc = bisectorpoint(P,C); path La = endptproject((A+P)/2,Fa,20,-30), Lb = endptproject((B+P)/2,Fb,12,-35); D(La,bluedots);D(Lb,bluedots);D(endptproject((C+P)/2,Fc,18,-15),bluedots);D(IP(La,Lb),blue);  [/asy]\tThe diagram shows $P$ outside of the grayed locus; notice that the creases [the dotted blue] intersect within the triangle, which is against the problem conditions. The area of the locus is the sum of two segments of two circles; these segments cut out $120^{\\circ}, 60^{\\circ}$ angles by simple similarity relations and angle-chasing.\nHence, the answer is, using the $\\frac 12 ab\\sin C$ definition of triangle area, $\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\cdot 18^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 18^2 \\sin \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\right] + \\left[\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cdot \\left(18\\sqrt{3}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (18\\sqrt{3})^2 \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right] = 270\\pi - 324\\sqrt{3}$, and $q+r+s = \\boxed{597}$."
