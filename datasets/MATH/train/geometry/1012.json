    "problem": "A bowling ball cannot weigh more than 16 pounds and must have a diameter of $8 \\frac{1}{2}$ inches. How many square inches are in the surface area of a bowling ball before the finger holes are drilled? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is \\[4\\pi r^2.\\]  The sphere in question has diameter $8\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{17}{2}$, radius $\\frac{17}{4}$, and surface area  \\[4\\pi\\left(\\frac{17}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{17^2}{4}\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{289\\pi}{4}}.\\]"
