It turns out this triangle is similar to the $6-8-10$ triangle (Proof: Realize that the slope of the line made while the circle is on $AC$ is the same as line $AC$ and that it makes a right angle when the circle switches from being on $AB$ to $BC$). Then, drop the perpendiculars as shown.\nSince the smaller triangle is also a $6-8-10 = 3-4-5$ triangle, we can label the sides $EF,$ $CE,$ and $DF$ as $3x, 4x,$ and $5x$ respectively. Now, it is clear that $GB = DE + 1 = 4x + 1$, so $AH = AG = 8 - GB = 7 - 4x$ since $AH$ and $AG$ are both tangent to the circle P at some point. We can apply the same logic to the other side as well to get $CI = 5 - 3x$. Finally, since we have $HI = DF = 5x$, we have $AC = 10 = (7 - 4x) + (5x) + (5 - 3x) = 12 - 2x$, so $x = 1$ and $3x + 4x + 5x = \\boxed{12}$"
