    "problem": "In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=10$, $AC=6$ and $BC=8$ units.  What is the distance from $C$ to the midpoint of segment $AB$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  Therefore, the desired distance is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$."
