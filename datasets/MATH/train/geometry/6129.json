    "problem": "A circle with center $O$ has radius 25. Chord $\\overline{AB}$ of length 30 and chord $\\overline{CD}$ of length 14 intersect at point $P$. The distance between the midpoints of the two chords is 12. The quantity $OP^2$ can be represented as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $m + n$ is divided by 1000.\n",

    "solution": "Let $E$ and $F$ be the midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, respectively, such that $\\overline{BE}$ intersects $\\overline{CF}$.\nSince $E$ and $F$ are midpoints, $BE = 15$ and $CF = 7$.\n$B$ and $C$ are located on the circumference of the circle, so $OB = OC = 25$.\nThe line through the midpoint of a chord of a circle and the center of that circle is perpendicular to that chord, so $\\triangle OEB$ and $\\triangle OFC$ are right triangles (with $\\angle OEB$ and $\\angle OFC$ being the right angles). By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OE = \\sqrt{25^2 - 15^2} = 20$, and $OF = \\sqrt{25^2 - 7^2} = 24$.\nLet $x$, $a$, and $b$ be lengths $OP$, $EP$, and $FP$, respectively. OEP and OFP are also right triangles, so $x^2 = a^2 + 20^2 \\to a^2 = x^2 - 400$, and $x^2 = b^2 + 24^2 \\to b^2 = x^2 - 576$\nWe are given that $EF$ has length 12, so, using the Law of Cosines with $\\triangle EPF$:\n$12^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos (\\angle EPF) = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos (\\angle EPO + \\angle FPO)$\nSubstituting for $a$ and $b$, and applying the Cosine of Sum formula:\n$144 = (x^2 - 400) + (x^2 - 576) - 2 \\sqrt{x^2 - 400} \\sqrt{x^2 - 576} \\left( \\cos \\angle EPO \\cos \\angle FPO - \\sin \\angle EPO \\sin \\angle FPO \\right)$\n$\\angle EPO$ and $\\angle FPO$ are acute angles in right triangles, so substitute opposite/hypotenuse for sines and adjacent/hypotenuse for cosines:\n$144 = 2x^2 - 976 - 2 \\sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 400}}{x} \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 576}}{x} - \\frac{20}{x} \\frac{24}{x} \\right)$\nCombine terms and multiply both sides by $x^2$: $144 x^2 = 2 x^4 - 976 x^2 - 2 (x^2 - 400) (x^2 - 576) + 960  \\sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)}$\nCombine terms again, and divide both sides by 64: $13 x^2 = 7200 - 15 \\sqrt{x^4 - 976 x^2 + 230400}$\nSquare both sides: $169 x^4 - 187000 x^2 + 51,840,000 = 225 x^4 - 219600 x^2 + 51,840,000$\nThis reduces to $x^2 = \\frac{4050}{7} = (OP)^2$; $4050 + 7 \\equiv \\boxed{57} \\pmod{1000}$."
