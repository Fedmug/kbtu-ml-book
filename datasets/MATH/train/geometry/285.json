    "problem": "The endpoints of a diameter of circle $M$ are $(-1,-4)$ and $(-7,6)$. What are the coordinates of the center of circle $M$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "The midpoint of a diameter of a circle is its center. Thus, $M$ is the midpoint of the segment from $(-1,-4)$ to $(-7,6),$ so $M$ has coordinates \\[\\left(\\frac{-1+(-7)}{2},\\frac{-4+6}{2} \\right)=\\boxed{(-4,1)}.\\]"
