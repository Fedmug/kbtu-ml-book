    "problem": "A circle of radius $2$ has center at $(2,0)$. A circle of radius $1$ has center at $(5,0)$.  A line is tangent to the two circles at points in the first quadrant.  What is the $y$-intercept of the line?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $D$ and $F$ denote the centers of the circles. Let $C$ and $B$ be the points where the $x$-axis and $y$-axis intersect the tangent line, respectively. Let $E$ and $G$ denote the points of tangency as shown. We know that $AD=DE=2$, $DF=3$, and $FG=1$. Let $FC=u$ and $AB=y$. Triangles $FGC$ and $DEC$ are similar, so $${\\frac u1} = \\frac{u+3}{2},$$ which yields $u=3$.  Hence, $GC = \\sqrt{8}$.  Also, triangles $BAC$ and  $FGC$ are similar, which yields $$\\frac y1={BA\\over FG}={AC\\over GC}=\\frac {8}{\\sqrt{8}}=\\sqrt{8}\n=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}.$$ [asy]\nimport olympiad; import geometry; size(200); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\ndraw((0,sqrt(8))--(0,0)--(8,0)--cycle);\ndraw(Arc((2,0),2,0,180)); draw(Arc((5,0),1,0,180));\ndraw(rightanglemark((2,0),foot((2,0),(0,sqrt(8)),(8,0)),(8,0),5));\ndraw(rightanglemark((5,0),foot((5,0),(0,sqrt(8)),(8,0)),(8,0),5));\ndraw(rightanglemark((0,sqrt(2)),(0,0),(8,0),5));\ndraw((2,0)--foot((2,0),(0,sqrt(8)),(8,0))--(8,0));\ndraw((5,0)--foot((5,0),(0,sqrt(8)),(8,0))--(8,0));\ndot(\"$D$\",(2,0),S); dot(\"$E$\",foot((2,0),(0,sqrt(8)),(8,0)),N);\ndot(\"$F$\",(5,0),S); dot(\"$G$\",foot((5,0),(0,sqrt(8)),(8,0)),N);\ndot(\"$A$\",origin,S); dot(\"$B$\",(0,sqrt(8)),NW); dot(\"$C$\",(8,0),S);\n[/asy]"
