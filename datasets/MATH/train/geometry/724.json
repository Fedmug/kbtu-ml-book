    "problem": "A sphere is cut into four congruent wedges. The circumference of the sphere is $12\\pi$ inches. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one wedge? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let the sphere's radius be $r$.  From the sphere's circumference we have $2\\pi r = 12\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r = 6$.  The volume of the sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6^3) = 36\\cdot 8 \\pi$.  The volume of one wedge is one-fourth this volume, or $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 6^2\\cdot 8 \\pi = 6^2\\cdot 2\\pi = \\boxed{72\\pi}$."
