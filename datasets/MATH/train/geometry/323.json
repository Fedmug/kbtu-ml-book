    "solution": "The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is $(1/3) \\pi r^2 h$; the volume of a cylinder with similar dimensions is $\\pi r^2 h$.  The cone has the same radius as the cylinder and half the height, so it has $1/3$ the volume of half the cylinder and thus has $1/2\\cdot 1/3 = 1/6$ the volume of the whole cylinder.  Hence the desired ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$."
