The triangle's altitude from $F$ to side $EG$ is 7 inches, and $EG = 10 \\text{ inches}$. The length of segment $AB$ is equal to half the length of segment $AD$. What is the area of rectangle $ABCD$?

    "solution": "Suppose that the altitude from $F$ to $EG$ intersects $EG$ at point $H$.  Then $\\triangle EAB \\sim \\triangle EHF$, and we have that $\\frac{HE}{HF} = \\frac{AE}{AB}$.  Also, $\\triangle GDC \\sim GHF$, and $\\frac{HG}{HF} = \\frac{DG}{DC}$.  Adding these equalities, we find that $\\frac{HE + HG}{HF} = \\frac{AE + DG}{AB}$, since $AB = DC$.  But $HE + HG = EG = 10$, $HF = 7$, and finally $AE + DG = EG - AD = 10 - 2AB$.  Plugging in, we find that $\\frac{10}{7} = \\frac{10-2AB}{AB}$, or $AB = \\frac{35}{12}$.  Thus the area of $ABCD$ is $\\frac{35}{12}\\cdot\\frac{35}{6} =\\boxed{ \\frac{1225}{72}}$."
