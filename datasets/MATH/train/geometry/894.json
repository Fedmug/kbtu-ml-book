    "solution": "Clearly, triangle $ABC$ is isosceles.  This is the first.  We know $\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB=72^{\\circ}$, which tells us that $\\angle BAC = 180^\\circ-72^\\circ-72^\\circ=36^\\circ$ .  Since segment $BD$ bisects angle $ABC$, the measure of angle $ABD$ is $72^\\circ/2=36^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\angle BAD = \\angle ABD$ and $\\triangle ABD$ is isosceles.\n\nSince $\\triangle ABD$ is isosceles, we see that $m\\angle ADB=180^\\circ-36^\\circ-36^\\circ=108^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\angle BDC=180^\\circ-108^\\circ=72^\\circ$.  Looking at triangle $BDC$, we already know that $\\angle DCB=72^\\circ=\\angle BDC$ degrees, so this triangle is isosceles.\n\nNext, we use the fact that $DE$ is parallel to $AB$.  Segment $BD$ is a transversal, so the alternate interior angles $ABD$ and $BDE$ are congruent.  Thus, $m\\angle ABD=m\\angle BDE=36^\\circ$.  We already knew that $m\\angle DBE=36^\\circ$ since $BD$ bisects $\\angle ABC$.  Thus, the triangle $BDE$ is isosceles.\n\nLooking at angle $EDF$, we can see that $m\\angle EDF=180^\\circ-m\\angle BDA-m\\angle BDE=180^\\circ-108^\\circ-36^\\circ=36^\\circ$.  We also know that $EF$ is parallel to $BD$, and so the alternate interior angles $\\angle BDE$ and $\\angle FED$ are congruent.  Thus, $m\\angle FED=36^\\circ$ and triangle $DEF$ is isosceles.\n\nWe have nearly found them all.  We can compute that $\\angle EFD=180^\\circ-36^\\circ-36^\\circ=108^\\circ$, and so $\\angle EFC=180^\\circ-108^\\circ=72^\\circ$ degrees.  From the very beginning, we know that $m\\angle ACB =72^\\circ$, so $\\triangle FEC$ is isosceles.  This makes $m\\angle FEC=180^\\circ-72^\\circ-72^\\circ=36^\\circ$ degrees, and so $m\\angle DEC=36^\\circ+36^\\circ=72^\\circ$.  So, our final isosceles triangle is $DEC$.  We have found a total of $\\boxed{7}$ isosceles triangles."
