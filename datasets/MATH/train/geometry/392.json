    "problem": "Parallelogram $ABCD$ has vertices $A(3,3)$, $B(-3,-3)$, $C(-9,-3)$, and $D(-3,3)$. If a point is selected at random from the region determined by the parallelogram, what is the probability that the point is not above the $x$-axis? Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "solution": "Let us first call the point where the $x$-axis intersects side $\\overline{AB}$ point $E$ and where it intersects $\\overline{CD}$ point $F$. [asy]\ndraw((-12,0)--(6,0),Arrows);\ndraw((0,-6)--(0,6),Arrows);\n\nfor(int i = -11; i < 6; ++i)\n{\n\ndraw((i,.5)--(i,-.5));\n}\n\nfor(int i = -5; i < 6; ++i)\n{\n\ndraw((.5,i)--(-.5,i));\n}\n\ndot((3,3));\ndot((-3,-3));\ndot((-9,-3));\ndot((-3,3));\ndot((0,0));\ndot((-6,0));\n\ndraw((3,3)--(-3,-3)--(-9,-3)--(-3,3)--cycle, linewidth(.65));\ndraw((0,0)--(-6,0), linewidth(.65));\n\nlabel(\"A\",(3,3),NE);\nlabel(\"B\",(-3,-3),SE);\nlabel(\"C\",(-9,-3),SW);\nlabel(\"D\",(-3,3),NW);\nlabel(\"F\",(-6,0),NW);\nlabel(\"E\",(0,0),NW);\n[/asy] Now, since the $x$-axis is parallel to bases $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ of the parallelogram, $\\overline{EF}$ is parallel to the two bases and splits parallelogram $ABCD$ into two smaller parallelograms $AEFD$ and $EBCF$. Since the height of each of these parallelograms is $3$ and the length of their bases equals $AD=BC=6$, both parallelograms must have the same area. Half of parallelogram $ABCD$'s area is above the $x$-axis and half is below, so there is a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that the point selected is not above the $x$-axis."
