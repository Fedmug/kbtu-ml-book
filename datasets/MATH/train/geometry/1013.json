    "solution": "Let $t$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$ (which is what we want to compute).\n\nSince $AX=XY$, we have $\\angle AYX = \\angle YAX = \\angle BAC = t^\\circ$. Then, since the sum of angles in $\\triangle AXY$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle AXY = (180-2t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AXY$ and $\\angle BXY$ add to form a straight angle, so they are supplementary; $\\angle BXY = (180-(180-2t))^\\circ = (2t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $XY=YB$, we have $\\angle XBY = \\angle BXY = (2t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle XYB$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle XYB = (180-4t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AYX$, $\\angle XYB$, and $\\angle BYC$ add to form a straight angle, so their sum is $180^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle BYC = (180-t-(180-4t))^\\circ = (3t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $YB=BC$, we have $\\angle YCB = \\angle BYC = (3t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle YBC$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle YBC = (180-6t)^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle ABC = \\angle XBY + \\angle YBC = (2t)^\\circ + (180-6t)^\\circ = (180-4t)^\\circ$. We know this is equal to $120^\\circ$, so we solve the equation $$180-4t = 120$$ to obtain $t=\\boxed{15}$."
