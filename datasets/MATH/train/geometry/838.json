    "solution": "There are 10 cubes, thus, there are 10 sq. units in each of the faces facing towards us and away from us.  The figure has a height of 3, so there 6 sq. units total in each of the vertical sides.  And the figure has a total width of 4 cubes, so despite the fact that there is overlap, there is still a horizontal width of 4, making for 4 sq. units in each of the horizontal sides, making 8 total sq. units.  Thus, there is a total of $10 + 10 + 8 + 6 = \\boxed{34\\text{ sq. units}}$."
