    "problem": "Let $\\triangle ABC$ have side lengths $AB=13$, $AC=14$, and $BC=15$.  There are two circles located inside $\\angle BAC$ which are tangent to rays $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{AC}$, and segment $\\overline{BC}$.  Compute the distance between the centers of these two circles.",

    "solution": "The two circles described in the problem are shown in the diagram.  The circle located inside $\\triangle ABC$ is called the incircle; following convention we will label its center $I$.  The other circle is known as an excircle, and we label its center $E$.  To begin, we may compute the area of triangle $ABC$ using Heron's formula.  The side lengths of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ are $a=15$, $b=14$, and $c=13$, while the semiperimeter is $s=\\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)=21$, so its area is \\[ K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{21\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8} = 84. \\]We find the inradius $r$ of $\\triangle ABC$ by using the fact that $K=rs$, so $84=21r$, giving $r=4$.  Next label the points of tangency of the incircle and excircle with ray $\\overline{AC}$ as $S$ and $T$, as shown at right.  It is a standard fact that $AS=s-a=6$ and $AT=s=21$. (The reader should confirm this.  Repeatedly use the fact that tangents from a point to a circle have the same length.)  Furthermore, the angle bisector of $\\angle A$ passes through $I$ and $E$, and the radii $\\overline{SI}$ and $\\overline{TE}$ are perpendicular to $\\overline{AC}$, so triangles $\\triangle ASI$ and $\\triangle ATE$ are similar right triangles.  By the Pythagorean Theorem we compute \\[ AI = \\sqrt{(AS)^2+(SI)^2} = \\sqrt{36+16}=2\\sqrt{13}. \\]Using the similar triangles we find that $AI/AE = AS/AT = 6/21 = 2/7$.  Therefore $AE=7\\sqrt{13}$ and we conclude that $IE=AE-AI=\\boxed{5\\sqrt{13}}$.\n\n[asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\ndraw((0,0)--(4,0)--(3,5)--cycle);\ndraw(incircle((0,0),(4,0),(3,5)));\nreal x = 1.15;\npair A = (0,0) + x*(-3,-5);\npair B = (4,0) + x*(1,-5);\ndraw(A--(3,5)--B--cycle);\ndraw(incircle(A,(3,5),B));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(3,5),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(4,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,0),W);\npair I = incenter((0,0),(3,5),(4,0));\npair iFoot = foot(I,(0,0),(3,5));\nlabel(\"$S$\",iFoot,W);\nlabel(\"$I$\",I,E);\ndraw(iFoot--I);\npair I2 = incenter(A,(3,5),B);\npair iFoot2 = foot(I2,(0,0),(3,5));\nlabel(\"$T$\",iFoot2,W);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I2,S);\ndraw(iFoot2--I2);\ndraw((3,5)--(I2));\n[/asy]"
