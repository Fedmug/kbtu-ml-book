    "problem": "An equilateral triangle has an area of $64\\sqrt{3}$ $\\text{cm}^2$. If each side of the triangle is decreased by 4 cm, by how many square centimeters is the area decreased?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "We first consider an equilateral triangle with side length $s$. If we construct an altitude, it will divide the equilateral triangle into two congruent $30-60-90$ triangles with the longest side having length $s$ and the altitude opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle. Since the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle are in a $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$ ratio, the altitude will have length $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Since the base of this equilateral triangle is $s$, its area will be $\\frac{1}{2}{b}{h}=\\frac{1}{2}s \\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nNow we can set this expression equal to $64\\sqrt{3}$ and solve for $s$ to find the side length of our original triangle. Doing this, we get that $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}=64\\sqrt{3}$. We can then multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$ to get that $s^2=256$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $s=16$, so the original triangle had a side length of $16$ cm. If we decrease this by $4$ cm, we get that the new triangle has side length $12$ cm and therefore has an area of $\\frac{144 \\sqrt{3}}{4}=36\\sqrt{3}$ cm. Therefore, the area is decreased by $64\\sqrt{3}-36\\sqrt{3}=\\boxed{28\\sqrt{3}}$ cm."
