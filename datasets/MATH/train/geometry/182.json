    "problem": "Two chords, $AB$ and $CD,$ meet inside a circle at $P.$  If $AP = 3$ and $CP = 8,$ then what is $\\frac{BP}{DP}$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "By the Power of a Point formula, we know that $AP \\cdot BP = CP \\cdot DP.$ Substituting, we have $3 \\cdot BP = 8 \\cdot DP.$ Then, we have $\\frac{BP}{DP} = \\boxed{\\frac{8}{3}}.$"
