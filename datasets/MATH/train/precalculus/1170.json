    "problem": "Let $v$ and $w$ be distinct, randomly chosen roots of the equation $z^{1997}-1=0.$  Find the probability that\n\\[\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{3}}\\le\\left|v+w\\right|.\\]",

    "solution": "The solutions of the equation $z^{1997} = 1$ are the $1997$th roots of unity and are equal to $\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right)$ for $k = 0,1,\\ldots,1996.$  They are also located at the vertices of a regular $1997$-gon that is centered at the origin in the complex plane.\n\nBy rotating around the origin, we can assume that $v = 1.$  Then\n\\begin{align*}\n|v + w|^2 & = \\left|\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + 1 \\right|^2 \\\\\n& = \\left|\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + 1\\right] + i\\sin\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right)\\right|^2 \\\\\n& = \\cos^2\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) + 1 + \\sin^2\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right) \\\\\n& = 2 + 2\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right).\n\\end{align*}We want $|v + w|^2\\ge 2 + \\sqrt {3}.$  From what we just obtained, this is equivalent to $\\cos\\left(\\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\right)\\ge \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}2.$  This occurs when $\\frac {\\pi}6\\ge \\frac {2\\pi k}{1997}\\ge - \\frac {\\pi}6$ which is satisfied by $k = 166,165,\\ldots, - 165, - 166$ (we don't include 0 because that corresponds to $v$).  So out of the $1996$ possible $k$, $332$ work.  Thus, the desired probability is $\\frac{332}{1996} = \\boxed{\\frac{83}{499}}.$"
