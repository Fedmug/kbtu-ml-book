    "problem": "Suppose that $wz = 12-8i$, and $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$.  What is $|z|$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Since $wz = 12-8i$, we have  \\[|wz| = |12-8i| = |4(3-2i)| = 4|3-2i| = 4\\sqrt{3^2 + (-2)^2} = 4\\sqrt{13}.\\]Since $|wz| = |w|\\cdot |z|$, we have $|w|\\cdot |z| = 4\\sqrt{13}$.  Finally, since we are given that $|w| = \\sqrt{13}$, we have $|z| = \\boxed{4}$."
