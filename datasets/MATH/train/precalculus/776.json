    "solution": "We can take $\\begin{pmatrix} 12 \\\\ -4 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ as the normal vector of the plane.  Then the equation of the plane is of the form\n\\[12x - 4y + 3z + D = 0.\\]Substituting in the coordinates of $(12,-4,3),$ we find that the equation of the plane is $\\boxed{12x - 4y + 3z - 169 = 0}.$"
