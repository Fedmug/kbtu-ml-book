    "problem": "Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be the hyperbola $y^2 - x^2 = 1$.  Given a point $P_0$ on the $x$-axis, we construct a sequence of points $(P_n)$ on the $x$-axis in the following manner: let $\\ell_n$ be the line with slope 1 passing passing through $P_n$, then $P_{n+1}$ is the orthogonal projection of the point of intersection of $\\ell_n$ and $\\mathcal C$ onto the $x$-axis. (If $P_n = 0$, then the sequence simply terminates.)\n\nFind the number of starting positions $P_0$ on the $x$-axis such that $P_0 = P_{2008}$.  Your answer should use exponential notation, in simplest form.",

    "solution": "Let $P_n = (x_n, 0)$. Then the $\\ell_n$ meet $\\mathcal{C}$ at $(x_{n+1}, x_{n+1} - x_n)$. Since this point lies on the hyperbola, we have $(x_{n+1} - x_n)^2 - x_{n+1}^2 = 1$. Rearranging this equation gives \\[\nx_{n+1} = \\frac{x_n^2 - 1}{2x_n}.\n\\]Choose a $\\theta_0 \\in (0, \\pi)$ with $\\cot\\theta_0 = x_0$, and define $\\theta_n = 2^n \\theta_0$. Using the double-angle formula, we have \\[\n\\cot \\theta_{n+1} = \\cot( 2 \\theta_n ) = \\frac{\\cot^2 \\theta_n - 1}{2 \\cot \\theta_n}.\n\\]It follows by induction that $x_n = \\cot \\theta_n$. Then, $P_0 = P_{2008}$ corresponds to $\\cot \\theta_0 = \\cot ( 2^{2008} \\theta_0 )$ (assuming that $P_0$ is never at the origin, or equivalently, $2^{n} \\theta$ is never an integer multiple of $\\pi$).\n\nSo, we need to find the number of $\\theta_0 \\in (0, \\pi)$ with the property that $2^{2008} \\theta_0 - \\theta_0 = k \\pi$ for some integer $k$. We have $\\theta_0 = \\frac{k \\pi}{2^{2008} - 1}$, so $k$ can be any integer between $1$ and $2^{2008}-2$ inclusive (and note that since the denominator is odd, the sequence never terminates). It follows that the number of starting positions is $\\boxed{2^{2008} -2}$."
