    "problem": "Determine the number of angles between 0 and $2 \\pi,$ other than integer multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{2},$ such that $\\sin \\theta,$ $\\cos \\theta$, and $\\tan \\theta$ form a geometric sequence in some order.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "We divide into cases.\n\nCase 1: $\\sin \\theta \\tan \\theta = \\cos^2 \\theta.$\n\nThe equation becomes $\\sin^2 \\theta = \\cos^3 \\theta,$ which we can write as $1 - \\cos^2 \\theta = \\cos^3 \\theta.$  Letting $x = \\cos \\theta,$ we get\n\\[x^3 + x^2 - 1 = 0.\\]Let $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 1.$  Clearly $x = -1$ is not a root.  If $-1 < x \\le 0,$ then $x^2 + x^3 \\le x^2 < 1$, so\n\\[f(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 1 < 0.\\]The function $f(x)$ is increasing for $0 \\le x \\le 1.$  Also, $f(0) = -1$ and $f(1) = 1,$ so $f(x)$ has exactly one root in the interval $[0,1].$  Then the equation $\\cos \\theta = x$ has two solutions for $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2 \\pi.$\n\nCase 2: $\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\tan^2 \\theta.$\n\nThe equation becomes $\\cos^3 \\theta = \\sin \\theta.$  In the interval $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2},$ $\\sin \\theta$ increases from 0 to 1 while $\\cos^3 \\theta$ decreases from 1 to 0, so there is one solution in this interval.  Similarly, in the interval $\\pi \\le \\theta \\le \\frac{3 \\pi}{2},$ $\\sin \\theta$ decreases from 0 to $-1$ while $\\cos^3 \\theta$ increases from $-1$ to $0,$ so there is one solution in this interval.\n\nOn the intervals $\\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\theta < \\pi$ and $\\frac{3 \\pi}{2}  < \\theta < 2 \\pi,$ one of $\\sin \\theta$ and $\\cos^3 \\theta$ is positive while the other is negative, so there are no additional solutions.\n\nCase 3: $\\cos \\theta \\tan \\theta = \\sin^2 \\theta.$\n\nThe equation becomes $\\sin \\theta^2 = \\sin \\theta$, so $\\sin \\theta$ is 0 or 1.  The only solutions are integer multiples of $\\frac{\\pi}{2},$ so there are no solutions in this case.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of $\\boxed{4}$ solutions."
