    "problem": "When a positive integer is expressed in base 7, it is $AB_7$, and when it is expressed in base 5, it is $BA_5$.  What is the positive integer in decimal?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The number $AB_7$ is $7A + B$, and the number $BA_5$ is $5B + A$, so $7A + B = 5B + A$.  Then $6A = 4B$, so $3A = 2B$.  Then $B$ must be a multiple of 3.  But $B$ is also a digit in base 5, so $B = 3$, and $A = 2$.  The number is $7A + 2 = \\boxed{17}$."
