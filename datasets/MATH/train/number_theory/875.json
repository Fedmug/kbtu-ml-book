    "problem": "As $p$ ranges over the primes greater than $5$, how many different remainders can $p^2$ leave upon division by $120$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of $120$ is $120 = 2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to evaluate all possible remainders of $p^2$ upon division by each of $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. Since $p$ must be odd, it follows that $p = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Thus, $(2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k)(k+1) + 1$, and since at least one of $k$ and $k+1$ is even, then $$p^2 \\equiv 8 \\cdot \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}.$$Since $p$ is not divisible by $3$, then $p = 3l \\pm 1$ for some integer $l$, and it follows that $$p^2 \\equiv (3k \\pm 1)^2 \\equiv (\\pm 1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}.$$Finally, since $p$ is not divisible by $5$, then $p = 5m \\pm 1$ or $p = 5m \\pm 2$ for some integer $m$. Thus, $$p^2 \\equiv (5k \\pm 1)^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5} \\text{ or } p^2 \\equiv (5k \\pm 2)^2 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}.$$We now have two systems of three linear congruences; by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there are exactly $\\boxed{2}$ remainders that $p^2$ can leave upon division by $120$. We can actually solve the congruences to find that $p^2 \\equiv 1, 49 \\pmod{120}$: for $p = 7$, we have $p^2 = 49$, and for $p = 11$, we have $p^2 = 121 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{120}$."
