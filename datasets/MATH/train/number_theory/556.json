    "problem": "One year ago, the number of years in Jane's age was a perfect square, and one year from now, her age will be a perfect cube. How many years old is Jane?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let's consider a few small perfect cubes to see two less which is a perfect square: $2^3-2=6$, not a perfect square; $3^3-2=25=5^2$. Thus Jane is $27-1=\\boxed{26}$ years old."
