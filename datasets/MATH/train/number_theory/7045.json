    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We express the numbers as $x=100a+10b+c$ and $y=100c+10b+a$. From this, we have\\begin{eqnarray*}z&=&|100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a|\\\\&=&|99a-99c|\\\\&=&99|a-c|\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}Because $a$ and $c$ are digits, and $a$ and $c$ are both between 1 and 9 (from condition 1), there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible values (since all digits except $9$ can be expressed this way)."
