    "problem": "How many numbers from $1$ to $150$ are not perfect squares or perfect cubes?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The largest perfect square less than $150$ is $12^2=144$. Therefore, there are $12$ perfect squares between $1$ and $150$.\n\nThe largest perfect cube less than $150$ is $5^3=125$. Therefore, there are $5$ perfect cubes between $1$ and $150$.\n\nHowever, there are numbers between $1$ and $150$ that are both perfect squares and perfect cubes. For a number to be both a perfect square and perfect cube, it must be a 6th power. The largest sixth power less than $150$ is $2^6=64$. Therefore, there are $2$ sixth powers between $1$ and $150$. Those two numbers are counted twice, so we have to subtract $2$ from the number of numbers that are a perfect square or perfect cube.\n\nTherefore, there are $12+5-2=15$ numbers that are either a perfect square or perfect cube. Therefore, there are $150-15= \\boxed{135}$ numbers that are neither a perfect square or a perfect cube."
