    "problem": "What multiple of 15 is closest to 2009?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "An integer is a multiple of 15 if and only if it is a multiple of both 3 and 5.  The multiple of 5 closest to 2009 is 2010, and since $2+0+1+0$ is divisible by 3, $\\boxed{2010}$ is divisible by 15."
