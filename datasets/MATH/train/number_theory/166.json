    "problem": "What is the smallest integer $k$ such that $k>1$ and $k$ has remainder $1$ when divided by any of $17,$ $6,$ and $2?$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can re-write the problem as the following three equations: $$k = 17a+1\\\\k = 6b+1 \\\\ k = 2c + 1$$Therefore, $k-1$ is divisible by $17,$ $6,$ and $2.$ The smallest positive value of $k-1$ is thus $$\\text{lcm}[17,6,2] = \\text{lcm}[17,6] = 17\\cdot 6 = 102,$$and so the smallest possible value of $k$ is $k = 102+1 = \\boxed{103}.$"
