    "problem": "When three positive integers are divided by $12$, the remainders are $7,$ $9,$ and $10,$ respectively.\n\nWhen the sum of the three integers is divided by $12$, what is the remainder?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can call the three integers in this problem $a,$ $b,$ and $c$. Then we have \\begin{align*}\na &\\equiv 7\\pmod{12}, \\\\\nb &\\equiv 9\\pmod{12}, \\\\\nc &\\equiv 10\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Adding these congruences, we have \\begin{align*}\na+b+c &\\equiv 7+9+10 \\\\\n&= 26\\pmod{12}.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a+b+c$ has the same remainder as $26$ upon division by $12$. This remainder is $\\boxed{2}$."
