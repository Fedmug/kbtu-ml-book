    "problem": "What is the smallest prime divisor of $5^{23} + 7^{17}$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since $5^{23}$ and $7^{17}$ are both odd, their sum is even and therefore divisible by 2.  There are no smaller primes than $\\boxed{2}$, so it is the smallest prime divisor of the sum."
