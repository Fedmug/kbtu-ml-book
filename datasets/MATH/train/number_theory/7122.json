    "problem": "Let $S$ denote the sum of all of the three digit positive integers with three distinct digits. Compute the remainder when $S$ is divided by $1000$.\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We find the sum of all possible hundreds digits, then tens digits, then units digits. Every one of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the hundreds digit, and there are $9 \\cdot 8 = 72$ choices for the tens and units digits. Thus the sum of the hundreds places is $(1+2+3+\\cdots+9)(72) \\times 100 = 45 \\cdot 72 \\cdot 100 = 324000$.\nEvery one of $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ may appear as the tens digit; however, since $0$ does not contribute to this sum, we can ignore it. Then there are $8$ choices left for the hundreds digit, and $8$ choices afterwards for the units digit (since the units digit may also be $0$). Thus, the the sum of the tens digit gives $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 10 = 28800$.\nThe same argument applies to the units digit, and the sum of them is $45 \\cdot 64 \\cdot 1 = 2880$. Then $S = 324000+28800+2880 = 355\\boxed{680}$."
