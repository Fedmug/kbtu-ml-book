    "problem": "Kate has saved up $4444_8$ dollars for a trip to France. A round-trip airline ticket costs $1000_{10}$ dollars. In base ten, how many dollars will she have left for lodging and food?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "$4444_8=4\\cdot8^3+4\\cdot8^2+4\\cdot8^1+4\\cdot8^0=2048+256+32+4=2340_{10}$. Therefore, Kate will have $2340-1000=\\boxed{1340}$ dollars for lodging and food."
