    "problem": "The repeating decimal for $\\frac{3}{11}$ is $0.ababab\\dots$ What is the value of the sum $a+b$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If $\\frac{3}{11}=0.ababab\\ldots$, then, by multiplying both forms of this number by 100, we get $\\frac{300}{11}=ab.ababab\\ldots$. Now we can subtract:\n\n$$\\begin{array}{r r c r@{}l}\n&300/11 &=& ab&.ababab\\ldots \\\\\n- &3/11 &=& 0&.ababab\\ldots \\\\\n\\hline\n&297/11 &=& ab &\n\\end{array}$$\n\nWe can simplify $\\frac{297}{11}$ to $27$, giving us the two digits we sought: $a=2$ and $b=7$. Thus, $a+b = 2+7 = \\boxed{9}$.\n\n(Alternatively, we could solve this problem by long division.)"
