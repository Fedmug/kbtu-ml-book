    "problem": "What is the positive difference between the two largest prime factors of $159137$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of 159137: $159137=11\\cdot14467=11\\cdot17\\cdot851=11\\cdot17\\cdot23\\cdot37$. The positive difference between the two largest prime factors of 159137 is therefore $37-23=\\boxed{14}$."
