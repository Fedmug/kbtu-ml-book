    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Calculate the remainders when $1^2$, $2^2$, ..., $10^2$ are divided by 11 and sum them to find that the remainder when $1^2+2^2+\\cdots+10^2$ is divided by 11 is the same as that of $1+4+9+5+3+3+5+9+4+1=44$, which is $\\boxed{0}$."
