    "problem": "The number $0.428125$ can be written as a fraction $\\frac{a}{b}$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$. When this fraction is in simplest terms, what is $a+b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We can write $0.428125$ in the form $\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000}$. Note that $428,\\!000$ and $125$ are divisible by $5^3=125$. Therefore, we can divide numerator and denominator by 125 to obtain \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{125 \\cdot 3425}{125 \\cdot 8000}\\\\\n&=\\frac{3425}{8000}.\n\\end{align*}Since 3425 and 8000 are divisible by 25, we can simplify the fraction further: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{428,\\!125}{1,\\!000,\\!000} &= \\frac{3425}{8000} \\\\\n&= \\frac{5^2\\cdot 137}{5^2\\cdot 320} \\\\\n&= \\frac{137}{320}.\n\\end{align*}The sum of the numerator and denominator is $137 + 320 = \\boxed{457}$."
