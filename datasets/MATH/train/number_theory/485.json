    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If $x=.\\overline{28}$, then $100x=28.\\overline{28}$. Notice that we can eliminate the repeating decimal by subtracting $.\\overline{28}$ from $28.\\overline{28}$. We have $100x-x=99x=28$, so $x=\\frac{28}{99}$. The repeating decimal can be expressed as the fraction $\\boxed{\\frac{28}{99}}$."
