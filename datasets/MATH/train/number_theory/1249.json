    "problem": "You are given that $3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}$. What are the last three digits of $3^{12000}$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The last three digits are the same as the remainder when divided by $1000$.\n\n$3^{400}\\equiv 1\\pmod{1000}\\implies 3^{12000}=(3^{400})^{30}\\equiv 1^{30}=1\\pmod{1000}$.\n\nThus, the last three digits are $\\boxed{001}$."
