    "problem": "The letters of the alphabet are given numeric values based on the two conditions below.\n\n$\\bullet$  Only the numeric values of $-2,$ $-1,$ $0,$ $1$ and $2$ are used.\n\n$\\bullet$  Starting with A and going through Z, a numeric value is assigned to each letter according to the following pattern: $$\n1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0,\\ldots\n$$\n\nTwo complete cycles of the pattern are shown above. The letter A has a value of $1,$ B has a value of $2,$ F has a value of $-2$ and Z has a value of $2.$ What is the sum of the numeric values of the letters in the word ``numeric''?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The cycle has length $8$. So the numeric value of a letter is determined by its position within the alphabet, modulo $8$. So we determine the positions of all the letters in the word and use them to find the values:\n\nn is the $14$th letter. $14\\pmod 8=6$, so its value is $-2$.\n\nu is the $21$st letter. $21\\pmod 8=5$, so its value is $-1$.\n\nm is the $13$th letter. $13\\pmod 8=5$, so its value is $-1$.\n\ne is the $5$th letter. $5\\pmod 8=5$, so its value is $-1$.\n\nr is the $18$th letter. $18\\pmod 8=2$, so its value is $2$.\n\ni is the $9$th letter. $9\\pmod 8=1$, so its value is $1$.\n\nc is the $3$rd letter. $3\\pmod 8=3$, so its value is $1$.\n\nThe sum is $(-2)+(-1)+(-1)+(-1)+2+1+1=\\boxed{-1}$."
