    "problem": "What is the least common multiple of 135 and 468?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The prime factorization of 135 is $3^3 \\cdot 5$, and the prime factorization of 468 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13$.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 135 and 468 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{7020}$."
