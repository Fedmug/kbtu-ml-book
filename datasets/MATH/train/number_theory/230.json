    "problem": "What is the value of the least positive base ten number which requires six digits for its binary representation?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The least base 10 number which requires six digits for its binary representation is the one whose binary representation is $100000_2$. $100000_2=1\\cdot2^5=32_{10}$. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{32}$."
