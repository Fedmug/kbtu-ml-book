    "problem": "The number $2^{1993}+3^{1993}$ is a multiple of $5.$ What is the units digit of the quotient $\\frac{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}{5}?$",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We want to find the units digit of the quotient \\[\\frac{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}5.\\]We list the final two digits of  $2^n$ and $3^n$ in the next table. We also compute the units digit of the quotient whenever $2^n+3^n$ is divisible by $5.$\n\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n$n$&$2^n$&$3^n$&$2^n+3^n$&$\\frac{2^n+3^n}5$\\\\\n\\hline\n0&01&01&02&\\\\\n1&02&03&05&1\\\\\n2&04&09&13&\\\\\n3&08&27&35&7\\\\\n4&16&81&97&\\\\\n5&32&43&75&5\\\\\n6&64&29&93&\\\\\n7&28&87&15&3\\\\\n8&56&61&17&\\\\\n9&12&83&95&9\\\\\n10&24&49&73&\\\\\n11&48&47&95&9\\\\\n12&96&41&37&\\\\\n13&92&23&15&3\\\\\n14&84&69&53&\\\\\n15&68&07&75&5\\\\\n16&36&21&57&\\\\\n17&72&63&35&7\\\\\n18&44&89&33&\\\\\n19&88&67&55&1\\\\\n20&76&01&77&\\\\\n21&52&03&55&1\\\\\n22&04&09&13&\\\\\n23&08&27&35&7\\\\\n24&16&81&97&\\\\\n25&32&43&75&5\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}We notice that after the first pair, the sequence repeats every $20.$ Therefore \\[{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}\\equiv {2^{13}+3^{13}}\\equiv15\\pmod{100}.\\]So, the units digit of the quotient $\\frac{2^{1993}+3^{1993}}5$ is $\\boxed{3}.$\n\n(Note: \"mod 100\" essentially means \"remainder when the number is divided by 100\".  So, $2^{1993} + 3^{1993} \\equiv 15 \\pmod{100}$ means that $2^{1993} + 3^{1993}$ is 15 more than a multiple of 100.)"
