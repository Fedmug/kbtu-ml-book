    "problem": "How many integers between 100 and 300 have both 11 and 8 as factors?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The only numbers that have 11 and 8 as a factor are multiples of 88.  If we list the first few multiples of 88: $$88,176,264,352,...$$ we can see that there are exactly $\\boxed{2}$ between 100 and 300."
