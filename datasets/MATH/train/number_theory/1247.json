    "problem": "What integer $n$ satisfies $0\\le n<19$ and $$38574\\equiv n\\pmod{19}~?$$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Since 38 and 57 are both divisible by 19, so is $38000+570$.  Therefore we can say  \\[38574=19(2030)+4.\\]This tells us that  \\[38574\\equiv 4\\pmod{19}\\]The answer is $n=\\boxed{4}$."
