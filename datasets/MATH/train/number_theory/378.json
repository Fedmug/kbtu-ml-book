    "problem": "What is the sum of all positive integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "$\\frac{n+18}{n}=1+\\frac{18}{n}$. Thus, $\\frac{n+18}{n}$ is an integer if and only if $n|18$. The positive factors of 18 are 1, 18, 2, 9, 3, and 6. Their sum is $\\boxed{39}$."
