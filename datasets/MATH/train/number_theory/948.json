    "solution": "We can line up the numbers and add just as we do in base 10.  For example, in the second column we get $1+6=7$, which we carry just as in base 10 by placing the digit 0 in the sum and carrying 1 to the next column. We get $$\n\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c}\n& & 1 & 0_7 \\\\\n+ & 1 & 6 & 3_7 \\\\\n\\cline{2-4}\n& 2 & 0 & 3_7, \\\\\n\\end{array}$$so the sum is $\\boxed{203_7}$"
