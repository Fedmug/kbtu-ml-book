    "problem": "Each letter of the alphabet is assigned a value $(A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26)$. The product of a four-letter list is the product of the values of its four letters. The product of the list $ADGI$ is $(1)(4)(7)(9) = 252$. What is the only other four-letter list with a product equal to the product of the list $PQRS$? Write the letters of the four-digit list in alphabetical order.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The product of the list $PQRS$ is $(16)(17)(18)(19)=(2^4)(17)(2\\cdot3^2)(19)$. Every value must be at most 26, so we cannot change the primes 17 and 19. However, $(2^4)(2\\cdot3^2)=(2^2\\cdot3)(2^3\\cdot3)=(12)(24)$, which represents $LX$. Thus, the four-letter list with a product equal to that of $PQRS$ is $\\boxed{LQSX}$."
