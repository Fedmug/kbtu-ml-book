    "problem": "What two-digit positive integer is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The least common multiple of these integers is $4\\cdot3\\cdot5=60$. Thus, a positive integer that is one more than a multiple of all the given integers is $60+1=\\boxed{61}$."
