    "problem": "What is the least positive integer that can be added to 412 to yield a multiple of 3?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Note that dividing 412 by 3 gives a quotient of 137 and a remainder of 1. Thus the next multiple of 3 is $3-1=\\boxed{2}$ more than 412."
