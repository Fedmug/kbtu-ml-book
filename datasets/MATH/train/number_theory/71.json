    "problem": "How many two-digit numbers can be written in the form $2^n$ where $n$ is an integer?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The smallest $n$ that works is $4$ with $2^4=16$ and the largest is $6$ with $2^6=64,$ so $n$ can be $4,\\ 5,$ or $6$ for $\\boxed{3}$ such numbers."
