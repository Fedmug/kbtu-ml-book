    "problem": "What is the greatest prime factor of 221?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Noticing that 221 is close to the perfect square 225, we write 221 as a difference of two squares: $221=225-4=15^2-2^2=(15-2)(15+2)=13\\cdot 17$.  The largest prime factor here is $\\boxed{17}$."
