    "problem": "What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "If $2n$ is a perfect square, then $n$ must be divisible by 2. Now if $3n$ is a perfect cube and $n$ is divisible by 2, then $n$ must be divisible by $3^2=9$ and by $2^3=8$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $2n$ is a perfect square and $3n$ is a perfect cube is $9\\times8=\\boxed{72}$."
