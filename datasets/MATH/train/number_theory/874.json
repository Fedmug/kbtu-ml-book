    "problem": "A group of 25 friends were discussing a large positive integer. ``It can be divided by 1,'' said the first friend. ``It can be divided by 2,'' said the second friend. ``And by 3,'' said the third friend. ``And by 4,'' added the fourth friend. This continued until everyone had made such a comment. If exactly two friends were incorrect, and those two friends said consecutive numbers, what was the least possible integer they were discussing?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Let $N$ denote the large positive integer that everyone is discussing.\n\nThe two incorrect numbers are consecutive numbers.  To get the smallest possible value of $N$, we must maximize the incorrect numbers. As such, we should start with the highest possible incorrect numbers and work down.\n\nSuppose the two incorrect numbers are 24 and 25.  Then $N$ must still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 23.$  This means $N$ is divisible by 3 and 8, so $N$ is divisible by $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$, contradiction.  So the two incorrect numbers cannot be 24 and 25.  We can eliminate the other high cases similarly.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 22, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 11.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 20, because $N$ would still be divisible by 4 and 5.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 18, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 9.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose the incorrect numbers were 16 and 17.  Then $N$ would still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 15, 18, 19, \\dots, 25$.  The lcm of these remaining numbers is\n\\[2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23 = 787386600,\\]which is not divisible by 16 or 17.  Thus, the incorrect numbers can be 16 and 17, and the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{787386600}$."
