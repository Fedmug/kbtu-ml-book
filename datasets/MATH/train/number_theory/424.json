    "problem": "Find the sum of $327_8$ and $73_8$ in base $8$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Summing the two numbers, you are left with a residue of $2$ when adding $7$ and $3$. Carrying over $1$, you once again have a residue of $2$ and carry over $1$. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & &_{1} & _{1}& \\\\ & & 3& 2 & 7_8 \\\\ &+ & & 7 & 3_8 \\\\ \\cline{2-5} && 4& 2 & 2_8 \\\\ \\end{array}$$Therefore, the sum is $\\boxed{422_8}$."
