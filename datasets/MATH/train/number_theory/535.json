    "problem": "Convert $115_{10}$ to base 11. Represent $10$ as $A$, if necessary.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "First we note that $11=11^1<115<11^2=121$. Therefore, we know that $115_{10}$ will be a two digit number in base 11. The digit in the $11^1$ place will be $\\text{A}$ because $10\\cdot 11^1$ is the largest multiple of $11$ that is less than or equal to $115$, and in base 11, $\\text{A}$ is used to represent $10$. The digit in the $11^0$ place will be $5$ because $115-110=5$. The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{A5}_{11}}$."
