    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Notice that by the sum of cubes factorization, $n^3 + 8 = (n+2)(n^2 - 2n + 4)$ is an integer divisible by $n+2$. Thus,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(n^3 + 9, n+2) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n^3 + 9 - (n^3 + 8), n+2) \\\\ \n& = \\text{gcd}\\,(1,n+2) \\\\\n& = \\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}"
