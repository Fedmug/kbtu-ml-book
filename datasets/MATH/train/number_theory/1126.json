    "problem": "Determine the residue of $-811\\pmod{24}$. Your answer should be an integer in the range $0,1,2,\\ldots,22,23$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Dividing 811 by 24 gives a quotient of 33, so the greatest multiple of 24 less than $-811$ is $24\\cdot -34=-816$. Thus $-811$ is $-811-(-816)=5$ more than a multiple of $24$. Since $0\\leq 5 < 24$, the residue of $-811$ is $\\boxed{5}$ (mod 24)."
