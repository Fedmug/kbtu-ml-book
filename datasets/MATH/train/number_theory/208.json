    "problem": "The bagel shop has enough benches to sit $204_6$ people. If $2$ people are supposed to sit on one bench, how many benches does the shop have?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "First, convert $204_6$ to base 10 to get $204_6=2\\cdot6^2+0\\cdot6^1+4\\cdot6^0=72+0+4=76$. Therefore, the shop has $76\\div2=\\boxed{38}$ benches"
