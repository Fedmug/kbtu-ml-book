    "problem": "The numbers 60, 221, and 229 are the legs and hypotenuse of a right triangle.  Find the multiplicative inverse to 450 modulo 3599.  (Express your answer as an integer $n$ with $0\\leq n<3599$.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We notice that $450=221+229,$ so that must be the connection.  The Pythagorean Theorem tells us  \\[60^2+221^2=229^2\\] so \\[229^2-221^2=60^2.\\] The difference of squares factorization tells us  \\[(229-221)(229+221)=3600\\] and taken modulo 3599 we get  \\[8\\cdot450\\equiv1\\pmod{3599}.\\] The answer is $\\boxed{8}$."
