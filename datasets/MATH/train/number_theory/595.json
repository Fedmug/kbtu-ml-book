    "problem": "Alicia has $n$ candies, where $n$ is a positive integer with three digits. If she buys $5$ more, she will have a multiple of $8$. If she loses $8$, she will have a multiple of $5$. What is the smallest possible value of $n$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "The given information can be expressed by the congruences \\begin{align*}n+5\\equiv 0\\pmod 8 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 8,\\\\n-8\\equiv 0\\pmod 5 \\quad\\implies\\quad& n\\equiv 3\\pmod 5.\\end{align*}Since $\\gcd(5,8)=1$, the above congruences imply $n\\equiv 3\\pmod{40}$. This also implies the original congruences so $n$ is of the form $3+40m$ for an integer $m$. The first few positive integers of that form are $3,43,83,123$. Thus $\\boxed{123}$ is the smallest such number with three digits."
