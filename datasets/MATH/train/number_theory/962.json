    "problem": "What is the largest integer that must divide the product of any $4$ consecutive integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Any $4$ consecutive integers will have at least one multiple of $3,$ an even number not divisible by $4,$ and a multiple of $4.$ Therefore the product of any $4$ consecutive integers must be divisible by $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4=\\boxed{24}.$\n\nWe can check that no larger number divides every product of four consecutive integers by considering $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot4=24$."
