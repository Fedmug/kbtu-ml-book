    "problem": "One more than $11$ times a certain prime $p$ is another prime $q$. What is the value of $q$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We try plugging in values for $p$ and see if $11p+1$ is a prime number. The smallest prime number is $2$, so we try $11(2)+1=23$, which is prime. The value of $q$ is $\\boxed{23}$."
