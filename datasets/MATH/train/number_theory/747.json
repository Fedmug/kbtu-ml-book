    "problem": "Given that $x$ is a multiple of $23478$, what is the greatest common divisor of $f(x)=(2x+3)(7x+2)(13x+7)(x+13)$ and $x$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "In $f(x)$, all terms will have a multiple of $x$ except for the constant term, which is the multiple of the four constants $3,2,7$, and $13$.\n\nRecall (from the Euclidean algorithm) that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a-kb$ where $k,a,$ and $b$ are any integers. Therefore, finding the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor of $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$. Therefore, we want to find \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,((2x+3)(7x+2)(13x+7)(x+13),x) &=\\text{gcd}\\,(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 13, x)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(546,x).\n\\end{align*}Since $23478$ is a multiple of $546$, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $\\boxed{546}$."
