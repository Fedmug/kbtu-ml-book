    "problem": "What is the largest three-digit multiple of 9 whose digits' sum is 18?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We note that any integer whose digits' sum is $18=2\\cdot9$ is divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find the largest three-digit number whose digits' sum is 18. That number is $\\boxed{990}$."
