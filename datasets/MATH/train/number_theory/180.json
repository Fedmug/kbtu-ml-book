    "problem": "What is the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that are squares of perfect squares?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Squares of perfect squares are fourth powers. $1^4=1$, $2^4=16$, and $3^4=81$ are the only fourth powers less than 100. Their sum is $1+16+81=\\boxed{98}$."
