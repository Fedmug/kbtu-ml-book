    "problem": "Let $n = 2^4 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 4^6\\cdot 6^7$. How many natural-number factors does $n$ have?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Prime factorizing gives $n = 2^{23} \\cdot 3^{12}$. Since any positive factor of $n$ must be of the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b$ where $0 \\le a \\le 23$ and $0 \\le b \\le 12$, there are $(23+1)(12+1) = 24 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{312}$."
