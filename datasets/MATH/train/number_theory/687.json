    "problem": "What is the 200th term of the increasing sequence of positive integers formed by omitting only the perfect squares?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "When 200 is reached in the sequence of non-square positive integers, all the perfect squares from $1^2$ up to $14^2$ have been omitted.  Therefore, 200 is the 186th term.  The 187th term is 201, the 188th term is 202, $\\ldots$, the 200th term is $\\boxed{214}$."
