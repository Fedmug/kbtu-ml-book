    "solution": "As with solution $1$ we would like to note that given any quadrilateral we can change its angles to make a cyclic one.\nLet $a \\ge b \\ge c\\ge d$ be the sides of the quadrilateral.\nThere are $\\binom{31}{3}$ ways to partition $32$. However, some of these will not be quadrilaterals since they would have one side bigger than the sum of the other three. This occurs when $a \\ge 16$. For $a=16$, $b+c+d=16$. There are $\\binom{15}{2}$ ways to partition $16$. Since $a$ could be any of the four sides, we have counted $4\\binom{15}{2}$ degenerate quadrilaterals. Similarly, there are $4\\binom{14}{2}$, $4\\binom{13}{2} \\cdots 4\\binom{2}{2}$ for other values of $a$. Thus, there are $\\binom{31}{3} - 4\\left(\\binom{15}{2}+\\binom{14}{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{2}{2}\\right) = \\binom{31}{3} - 4\\binom{16}{3} = 2255$ non-degenerate partitions of $32$ by the hockey stick theorem. We then account for symmetry. If all sides are congruent (meaning the quadrilateral is a square), the quadrilateral will be counted once. If the quadrilateral is a rectangle (and not a square), it will be counted twice. In all other cases, it will be counted 4 times. Since there is $1$ square case, and $7$ rectangle cases, there are $2255-1-2\\cdot7=2240$ quadrilaterals counted 4 times. Thus there are $1+7+\\frac{2240}{4} = \\boxed{568}$ total quadrilaterals."
