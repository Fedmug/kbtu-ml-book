    "problem": "A set of $n$ people participate in an online video basketball tournament. Each person may be a member of any number of $5$-player teams, but no two teams may have exactly the same $5$ members. The site statistics show a curious fact: The average, over all subsets of size $9$ of the set of $n$ participants, of the number of complete teams whose members are among those $9$ people is equal to the reciprocal of the average, over all subsets of size $8$ of the set of $n$ participants, of the number of complete teams whose members are among those $8$ people. How many values $n$, $9\\leq n\\leq 2017$, can be the number of participants?\n$\\textbf{(A) } 477 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 482 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 487 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 557 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 562$\n",

    "solution": "Let there be $T$ teams. For each team, there are ${n-5\\choose 4}$ different subsets of $9$ players including that full team, so the total number of team-(group of 9) pairs is\n\\[T{n-5\\choose 4}.\\]\nThus, the expected value of the number of full teams in a random set of $9$ players is\n\\[\\frac{T{n-5\\choose 4}}{{n\\choose 9}}.\\]\nSimilarly, the expected value of the number of full teams in a random set of $8$ players is\n\\[\\frac{T{n-5\\choose 3}}{{n\\choose 8}}.\\]\nThe condition is thus equivalent to the existence of a positive integer $T$ such that\n\\[\\frac{T{n-5\\choose 4}}{{n\\choose 9}}\\frac{T{n-5\\choose 3}}{{n\\choose 8}} = 1.\\]\n\\[T^2\\frac{(n-5)!(n-5)!8!9!(n-8)!(n-9)!}{n!n!(n-8)!(n-9)!3!4!} = 1\\]\n\\[T^2 = \\big((n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)\\big)^2 \\frac{3!4!}{8!9!}\\]\n\\[T^2 = \\big((n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)\\big)^2 \\frac{144}{7!7!8\\cdot8\\cdot9}\\]\n\\[T^2 = \\big((n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)\\big)^2 \\frac{1}{4\\cdot7!7!}\\]\n\\[T = \\frac{(n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)}{2^5\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7}\\]\nNote that this is always less than ${n\\choose 5}$, so as long as $T$ is integral, $n$ is a possibility. Thus, we have that this is equivalent to\n\\[2^5\\cdot3^2\\cdot5\\cdot7\\big|(n)(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4).\\]\nIt is obvious that $5$ divides the RHS, and that $7$ does iff $n\\equiv 0,1,2,3,4\\mod 7$. Also, $3^2$ divides it iff $n\\not\\equiv 5,8\\mod 9$. One can also bash out that $2^5$ divides it in $16$ out of the $32$ possible residues $\\mod 32$.\nUsing all numbers from $2$ to $2017$, inclusive, it is clear that each possible residue $\\mod 7,9,32$ is reached an equal number of times, so the total number of working $n$ in that range is $5\\cdot 7\\cdot 16 = 560$. However, we must subtract the number of \"working\" $2\\leq n\\leq 8$, which is $3$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{557}$."
