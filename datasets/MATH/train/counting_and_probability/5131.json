    "solution": "Note that a $7$ digit increasing integer is determined once we select a set of $7$ digits. To determine the number of sets of $7$ digits, consider $9$ urns labeled $1,2,\\cdots,9$ (note that $0$ is not a permissible digit); then we wish to drop $7$ balls into these urns. Using the ball-and-urn argument, having $9$ urns is equivalent to $8$ dividers, and there are ${8 + 7 \\choose 7} = {15 \\choose 7} = 6435 \\equiv \\boxed{435} \\pmod{1000}$."
