    "problem": "Three cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a 4, the second card is a $\\clubsuit$, and the third card is a 2?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 4 exclusive cases:\n\nCase 1: first card not a $\\clubsuit$ and second card not a 2.\n\nThere are 3 cards that are 4's but not a $\\clubsuit$, so the probability for the first card is $\\dfrac{3}{52}$. Next, there are 12 $\\clubsuit$s remaining that aren't a 2, so the probability for the second card is $\\dfrac{12}{51}$. Finally, there are four 2's remaining, so the probability for the third card is $\\dfrac{4}{50}$.  Hence, this case gives a probability of $\\dfrac{3}{52}\\times \\dfrac{12}{51}\\times \\dfrac{4}{50} = \\dfrac{144}{132600}$.  (We leave the fraction in these terms rather than reducing because we know that we're going to need to add fractions later.)\n\nCase 2: first card not a $\\clubsuit$ and second card the 2$\\clubsuit$.\n\nThere are 3 cards that are 4's but not a $\\clubsuit$, so the probability for the first card is $\\dfrac{3}{52}$. Next, there is only one 2$\\clubsuit$, so the probability for the second card is $\\dfrac{1}{51}$. Finally, there are three 2's remaining, so the probability for the third card is $\\dfrac{3}{50}$.  Hence, this case gives a probability of $\\dfrac{3}{52}\\times \\dfrac{1}{51}\\times \\dfrac{3}{50} = \\dfrac{9}{132600}$.\n\nCase 3: first card the 4$\\clubsuit$ and second card not a 2.\n\nThere is only one 4$\\clubsuit$, so the probability for the first card is $\\dfrac{1}{52}$. Next, there are 11 $\\clubsuit$s remaining that aren't a 2, so the probability for the second card is $\\dfrac{11}{51}$. Finally, there are four 2's remaining, so the probability for the third card is $\\dfrac{4}{50}$.  Hence, this case gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\times \\dfrac{11}{51}\\times \\dfrac{4}{50} = \\dfrac{44}{132600}$.\n\nCase 4: first card the 4$\\clubsuit$ and second card the 2$\\clubsuit$.\n\nThere is only one 4$\\clubsuit$, so the probability for the first card is $\\dfrac{1}{52}$. Next, there is only one 2$\\clubsuit$, so the probability for the second card is $\\dfrac{1}{51}$. Finally, there are three 2's remaining, so the probability for the third card is $\\dfrac{3}{50}$.  Hence, this case gives a probability of $\\dfrac{1}{52}\\times \\dfrac{1}{51}\\times \\dfrac{3}{50} = \\dfrac{3}{132600}$.\n\nSo the overall probability is $\\dfrac{144+9+44+3}{132600} = \\dfrac{200}{132600} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{663}}$."
