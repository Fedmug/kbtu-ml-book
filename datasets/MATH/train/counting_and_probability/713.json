    "problem": "A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top three cards are all $\\spadesuit$s?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 13 ways to choose the first card to be a $\\spadesuit$, then 12 ways to choose the second card to be another $\\spadesuit$, then 11 ways to choose the third card to be a $\\spadesuit$.  There are $52 \\times 51 \\times 50$ ways to choose any three cards.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{13 \\times 12 \\times 11}{52 \\times 51 \\times 50} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{850}}$."
