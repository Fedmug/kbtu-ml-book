    "problem": "Three points are chosen uniformly at random on a circle. What is the probability that no two of these points form an obtuse triangle with the circle's center?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let us call the circle's center $O$.  We first note that if $A$ and $B$ are points on the circle, then triangle $AOB$ is isosceles with $AO= BO$.  Therefore, if $AOB$ is an obtuse triangle, then the obtuse angle must be at $O$.  So $AOB$ is an obtuse triangle if and only if minor arc $AB$ has measure of more than $\\pi/2$ ($90^\\circ$).\n\nNow, let the three randomly chosen points be $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_2$.  Let $\\theta$ be the measure of minor arc $A_0A_1$. Since $\\theta$ is equally likely to be any value from 0 to $\\pi$, the probability that it is less than $\\pi/2$ is 1/2.\n\nNow suppose that $\\theta < \\pi/2$.  For the problem's condition to hold, it is necessary and sufficient for point $A_2$ to lie within $\\pi/2$ of both $A_0$ and $A_1$ along the circumference. As the diagram below shows, this is the same as saying that $A_2$ must lie along a particular arc of measure $\\pi - \\theta$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(200);\ndefaultpen(.7);\n\npair O=(0,0), A=expi(4*pi/7), B=expi(3*pi/7);\n\ndraw(circle(O,1));\n\npair BB=rotate(90)*B;\npair AA=rotate(-90)*A;\n\npair LC= expi(5*pi/7), RC= expi(2*pi/7);\n\ndraw(O--BB..A..B..AA--O);\n\nfill(O--BB..LC..A--cycle,gray(.8));\nfill(O--A..(0,1)..B--cycle,gray(.6));\nfill(O--B..RC..AA--cycle,gray(.8));\n\npair SA=1.15*A,SB=1.15*B,SBB=1.15*BB;\npair SAA=1.15*AA,SLC=1.15*LC,SRC=1.15*RC;\n\nlabel(\"\\(A_0\\)\",SA,N);\nlabel(\"\\(A_1\\)\",SB,N);\n\ndraw(SBB..SLC..SA,Arrows,Bars);\ndraw(SA..(0,1.15)..SB,Arrows);\ndraw(SB..SRC..SAA,Arrows,Bars);\n\nlabel(\"\\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta\\)\",SLC,NW);\nlabel(\"\\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\theta\\)\",SRC,NE);\nlabel(\"\\(\\theta\\)\",(0,1.15),(0,1));\n[/asy]\n\nThe probability of this occurrence is $\\frac{\\pi-\\theta}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}$, since $A_2$ is equally likely to go anywhere on the circle. Since the average value of $\\theta$ between 0 and $\\pi/2$ is $\\pi/4$, it follows that the overall probability for $\\theta < \\pi/2$ is $\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\pi/4}{2\\pi} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\n\nSince the probability that $\\theta < \\pi/2$ is 1/2, our final probability is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$."
