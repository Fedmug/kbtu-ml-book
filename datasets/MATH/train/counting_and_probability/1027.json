    "solution": "From $E$ to $F$, it is 3 steps to the right and 1 step down, for a total of $\\dbinom{4}{1} = \\dfrac{4}{1} = 4$ different paths.  From $F$ to $G$, it is 2 steps to the right and 3 steps down, for a total of $\\dbinom{5}{2} = \\dfrac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$ different paths.  So there are $4 \\times 10 = \\boxed{40}$ paths from $E$ to $G$ that pass through $F$."
