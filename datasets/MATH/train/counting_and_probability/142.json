    "problem": "A box contains 5 white balls and 6 black balls.  Two balls are drawn out of the box at random.  What is the probability that they both are white?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{11}{2} = 55$ combinations of two balls that can be drawn.  There are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ combinations of two white balls that can be drawn.  So the probability that two balls pulled out are both white is $\\dfrac{10}{55} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{11}}$."
