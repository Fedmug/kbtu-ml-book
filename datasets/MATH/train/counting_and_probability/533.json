    "problem": "The positive four-digit integers that use each of the four digits $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ and $4$ exactly once are ordered from least to greatest. What is the $15^{\\text{th}}$ integer in the list?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Since there are so few numbers, we could simply list each of the $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$ combinations, but let's look at a more mathematical approach which we could also apply to larger sets of numbers.\n\nWe first consider how many of the numbers start with the digit $1.$ We have three more digits $(2,$ $3,$ and $4)$ to use. We can pick any of the three choices for the digit after the $1,$ and then either of the $2$ remaining choices for the third number, and finally, the $1$ remaining choice for the final number. Thus there are $3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$ possibilities for numbers that begin with the digit $1.$ $($For completeness, these are: $1234,$ $1243,$ $1324,$ $1342,$ $1423,$ $1432.)$\n\nThe same reasoning can be used for numbers that begin with the digit $2.$ Therefore there are $6$ numbers which begin with $2.$ $($For completeness, these are: $2134,$ $2143,$ $2314,$ $2341,$ $2413,$ $2431.)$ After this, we have found a total of $12$ of the numbers in the list of $4$-digit integers with the digits $1,$ $2,$ $3,$ and $4.$\n\nWe also have $6$ different numbers which can be formed with a leading $3.$ This makes a total of $18$ different numbers, since we want the $15^\\text{th}$ number, we can simply list these out in order from least to greatest, as specified in the problem.\n\n$\\bullet$ The $13^\\text{th}$ number is $3124.$\n\n$\\bullet$ The $14^\\text{th}$ number is $3142.$\n\n$\\bullet$ The $15^\\text{th}$ number is $3214.$\n\n$\\bullet$ The $16^\\text{th}$ number is $3241.$\n\n$\\bullet$ The $17^\\text{th}$ number is $3412.$\n\n$\\bullet$ The $18^\\text{th}$ number is $3421.$\n\nThus our answer is the $15\\text{th}$ number, or $\\boxed{3214}.$\n\nNote that we could have stopped listing the numbers above once we got to the $15\\text{th}$ number."
