    "problem": "Ten 6-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that exactly three of the dice show a 1? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest thousandth.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{10}{3}=120$ ways to select exactly three dice to roll 1's ones out of ten dice total. The probability of any one of these outcomes occurring is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^7$ and they're all mutually exclusive cases, so the probability that one of them will occur (which is the probability that we're looking for) is $\\binom{10}{3}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\right)^3\\left(\\dfrac{5}{6}\\right)^7=\\dfrac{120\\cdot5^7\\cdot1^3}{6^{10}}\\approx \\boxed{.155}$."
