    "problem": "Arnold is studying the prevalence of three health risk factors, denoted by A, B, and C, within a population of men. For each of the three factors, the probability that a randomly selected man in the population has only this risk factor (and none of the others) is 0.1. For any two of the three factors, the probability that a randomly selected man has exactly these two risk factors (but not the third) is 0.14. The probability that a randomly selected man has all three risk factors, given that he has A and B is $\\frac{1}{3}$. The probability that a man has none of the three risk factors given that he does not have risk factor A is $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.\n",

    "solution": "We first assume a population of $100$ to facilitate solving. Then we simply organize the statistics given into a Venn diagram.\n[asy]  pair A,B,C,D,E,F,G; A=(0,55); B=(60,55); C=(60,0); D=(0,0); draw(A--B--C--D--A); E=(30,35); F=(20,20); G=(40,20); draw(circle(E,15)); draw(circle(F,15)); draw(circle(G,15));  draw(\"$A$\",(30,52)); draw(\"$B$\",(7,7)); draw(\"$C$\",(53,7));  draw(\"100\",(5,60)); draw(\"10\",(30,40)); draw(\"10\",(15,15)); draw(\"10\",(45,15));  draw(\"14\",(30,16)); draw(\"14\",(38,29)); draw(\"14\",(22,29));  draw(\"$x$\",(30,25)); draw(\"$y$\",(10,45));  [/asy]\nLet $x$ be the number of men with all three risk factors. Since \"the probability that a randomly selected man has all three risk factors, given that he has A and B is $\\frac{1}{3}$,\" we can tell that $x = \\frac{1}{3}(x+14)$, since there are $x$ people with all three factors and 14 with only A and B. Thus $x=7$.\nLet $y$ be the number of men with no risk factors. It now follows that\\[y= 100 - 3 \\cdot 10 - 3 \\cdot 14 - 7 = 21.\\]The number of men with risk factor A is $10+2 \\cdot 14+7 = 45$ (10 with only A, 28 with A and one of the others, and 7 with all three). Thus the number of men without risk factor $A$ is 55, so the desired conditional probability is $21/55$. So the answer is $21+55=\\boxed{76}$."
