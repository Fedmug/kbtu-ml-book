    "problem": "For $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n\\}$ and each of its non-empty subsets a unique alternating sum is defined as follows. Arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order and then, beginning with the largest, alternately add and subtract successive numbers. For example, the alternating sum for $\\{1, 2, 3, 6,9\\}$ is $9-6+3-2+1=5$ and for $\\{5\\}$ it is simply $5$. Find the sum of all such alternating sums for $n=7$.\n",

    "solution": "Let $S$ be a non- empty subset of $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.\nThen the alternating sum of $S$, plus the alternating sum of $S \\cup \\{7\\}$, is $7$. This is because, since $7$ is the largest element, when we take an alternating sum, each number in $S$ ends up with the opposite sign of each corresponding element of $S\\cup \\{7\\}$.\nBecause there are $2^{6}=64$ of these pairs of sets, the sum of all possible subsets of our given set is $64 \\cdot 7$, giving an answer of $\\boxed{448}$."
