All regular 5-pointed stars are similar, but there are two non-similar regular 7-pointed stars. How many non-similar regular 1000-pointed stars are there?\n",

    "solution": "We use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE).\nIf we join the adjacent vertices of the regular $n$-star, we get a regular $n$-gon. We number the vertices of this $n$-gon in a counterclockwise direction: $0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n-1.$\nA regular $n$-star will be formed if we choose a vertex number $m$, where $0 \\le m \\le n-1$, and then form the line segments by joining the following pairs of vertex numbers: $(0 \\mod{n}, m \\mod{n}),$ $(m \\mod{n}, 2m \\mod{n}),$ $(2m \\mod{n}, 3m \\mod{n}),$ $\\cdots,$ $((n-2)m \\mod{n}, (n-1)m \\mod{n}),$ $((n-1)m \\mod{n}, 0 \\mod{n}).$\nIf $\\gcd(m,n) > 1$, then the star degenerates into a regular $\\frac{n}{\\gcd(m,n)}$-gon or a (2-vertex) line segment if $\\frac{n}{\\gcd(m,n)}= 2$. Therefore, we need to find all $m$ such that $\\gcd(m,n) = 1$.\nNote that $n = 1000 = 2^{3}5^{3}.$\nLet $S = \\{1,2,3,\\ldots, 1000\\}$, and $A_{i}= \\{i \\in S \\mid i\\, \\textrm{ divides }\\,1000\\}$. The number of $m$'s that are not relatively prime to $1000$ is: $\\mid A_{2}\\cup A_{5}\\mid = \\mid A_{2}\\mid+\\mid A_{5}\\mid-\\mid A_{2}\\cap A_{5}\\mid$ $= \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{5}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000}{2 \\cdot 5}\\right\\rfloor$ $= 500+200-100 = 600.$\nVertex numbers $1$ and $n-1=999$ must be excluded as values for $m$ since otherwise a regular n-gon, instead of an n-star, is formed.\nThe cases of a 1st line segment of (0, m) and (0, n-m) give the same star. Therefore we should halve the count to get non-similar stars.\nTherefore, the number of non-similar 1000-pointed stars is $\\frac{1000-600-2}{2}= \\boxed{199}.$"
