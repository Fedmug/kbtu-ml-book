    "problem": "The $52$ cards in a deck are numbered $1, 2, \\cdots, 52$. Alex, Blair, Corey, and Dylan each picks a card from the deck without replacement and with each card being equally likely to be picked, The two persons with lower numbered cards from a team, and the two persons with higher numbered cards form another team. Let $p(a)$ be the probability that Alex and Dylan are on the same team, given that Alex picks one of the cards $a$ and $a+9$, and Dylan picks the other of these two cards. The minimum value of $p(a)$ for which $p(a)\\ge\\frac{1}{2}$ can be written as $\\frac{m}{n}$. where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n",

    "solution": "Once the two cards are drawn, there are $\\dbinom{50}{2} = 1225$ ways for the other two people to draw. Alex and Dylan are the team with higher numbers if Blair and Corey both draw below $a$, which occurs in $\\dbinom{a-1}{2}$ ways. Alex and Dylan are the team with lower numbers if Blair and Corey both draw above $a+9$, which occurs in $\\dbinom{43-a}{2}$ ways. Thus,\\[p(a)=\\frac{\\dbinom{43-a}{2}+\\dbinom{a-1}{2}}{1225}.\\]Simplifying, we get $p(a)=\\frac{(43-a)(42-a)+(a-1)(a-2)}{2\\cdot1225}$, so we need $(43-a)(42-a)+(a-1)(a-2)\\ge (1225)$. If $a=22+b$, then\\begin{align*}(43-a)(42-a)+(a-1)(a-2)&=(21-b)(20-b)+(21+b)(20+b)=2b^2+2(21)(20)\\ge (1225) \\\\ b^2\\ge \\frac{385}{2} &= 192.5 >13^2 \\end{align*}So $b> 13$ or $b< -13$, and $a=22+b<9$ or $a>35$, so $a=8$ or $a=36$. Thus, $p(8) = \\frac{616}{1225} = \\frac{88}{175}$, and the answer is $88+175 = \\boxed{263}$."
