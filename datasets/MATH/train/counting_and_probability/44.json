    "solution": "Since $D$ and $C$ are located on segment $\\overline{AB}$, if $AB=3AD$, then $\\overline{AD}$ must take up $1/3$ of line segment $\\overline{AB}$. Similarly, since $AB=6BC$, $\\overline{BC}$ must take up $1/6$ of line segment $\\overline{AB}$. Then, $\\overline{CD}$ is the remaining segment of $\\overline{AB}$ and takes up $1-1/3 - 1/6 = 1/2$ of the total length of $\\overline{AB}$. Thus, if we were to choose a random point on segment $\\overline{AB}$, there would be a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that it is between points $C$ and $D$."
