    "problem": "Nine delegates, three each from three different countries, randomly select chairs at a round table that seats nine people. Let the probability that each delegate sits next to at least one delegate from another country be $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Use complementary probability and Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. If we consider the delegates from each country to be indistinguishable and number the chairs, we have\\[\\frac{9!}{(3!)^3} = \\frac{9\\cdot8\\cdot7\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4}{6\\cdot6} = 6\\cdot8\\cdot7\\cdot5 = 30\\cdot56\\]total ways to seat the candidates.\nOf these, there are $3 \\times 9 \\times \\frac{6!}{(3!)^2}$ ways to have the candidates of at least some one country sit together. This comes to\\[\\frac{27\\cdot6\\cdot5\\cdot4}6 = 27\\cdot 20.\\]\nAmong these there are $3 \\times 9 \\times 4$ ways for candidates from two countries to each sit together. This comes to $27\\cdot 4.$\nFinally, there are $9 \\times 2 = 18.$ ways for the candidates from all the countries to sit in three blocks (9 clockwise arrangements, and 9 counter-clockwise arrangements).\nSo, by PIE, the total count of unwanted arrangements is $27\\cdot 20 - 27\\cdot 4 + 18 = 16\\cdot27 + 18 = 18\\cdot25.$ So the fraction\\[\\frac mn = \\frac{30\\cdot 56 - 18\\cdot 25}{30\\cdot 56} = \\frac{56 - 15}{56} = \\frac{41}{56}.\\]Thus $m + n = 56 + 41 = \\boxed{097}.$"
