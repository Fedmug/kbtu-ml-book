    "problem": "George has an unfair six-sided die. The probability that it rolls a 6 is $\\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability that it rolls any other number is $\\frac{1}{10}$. What is the expected value of the number shown when this die is rolled? Express your answer as a decimal.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The expected value is $$\\frac{1}{10}(1) + \\frac{1}{10}(2) + \\frac{1}{10}(3) + \\frac{1}{10}(4) + \\frac{1}{10}(5) + \\frac{1}{2}(6) = \\frac{15}{10} + 3 = \\boxed{4.5}. $$"
