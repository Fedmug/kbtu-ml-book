    "problem": "Let $n$ be the number of ordered quadruples $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$ of positive odd integers that satisfy $\\sum_{i = 1}^4 x_i = 98.$ Find $\\frac n{100}.$\n",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Define $x_i = 2y_i - 1$. Then $2\\left(\\sum_{i = 1}^4 y_i\\right) - 4 = 98$, so $\\sum_{i = 1}^4 y_i = 51$.\nSo we want to find four natural numbers that sum up to 51; we can imagine this as trying to split up 51 on the number line into 4 ranges. This is equivalent to trying to place 3 markers on the numbers 1 through 50; thus the answer is $n = {50\\choose3} = \\frac{50 * 49 * 48}{3 * 2} = 19600$, and $\\frac n{100} = \\boxed{196}$."
