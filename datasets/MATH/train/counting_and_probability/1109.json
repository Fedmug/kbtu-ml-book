    "solution": "We first find the areas of the triangles under $l$ and $m$ and in the first quadrant. From $l$'s equation, we find that at $x = 6$, $y = 0$. From $m$, we find that at $x = \\frac{3}{2}$, we find that $y = 0$.\n\nWe then find the areas using the formula for a triangle: $\\frac{1}{2}bh$. The area under $l$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6\\times 6) = 18$. The area under $m$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\times 6\\right) = \\frac{9}{2}$. Thus, the probability that the point selected will fall between $l$ and $m$ has probability $\\frac{18 - \\frac{9}{2}}{18} = \\frac{27/2}{18} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$. Thus, the probability is $\\boxed{0.75}$."
