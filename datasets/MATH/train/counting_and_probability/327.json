    "problem": "We flip a fair coin 10 times.  What is the probability that we get heads in at least 8 of the 10 flips?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible outcomes of the 10 coin flips. The number of ways to get 8, 9, or 10 heads is $\\binom{10}{8}+\\binom{10}{9}+\\binom{10}{10}=45+10+1=56$.  So the probability is $\\dfrac{56}{1024}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{128}}$."
