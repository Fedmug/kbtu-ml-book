    "problem": "Let $p$ be the probability that, in the process of repeatedly flipping a fair coin, one will encounter a run of $5$ heads before one encounters a run of $2$ tails. Given that $p$ can be written in the form $m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.\n",

    "solution": "Think of the problem as a sequence of H's and T's. No two T's can occur in a row, so the sequence is blocks of $1$ to $4$ H's separated by T's and ending in $5$ H's. Since the first letter could be T or the sequence could start with a block of H's, the total probability is that $3/2$ of it has to start with an H.\nThe answer to the problem is then the sum of all numbers of the form $\\frac 32 \\left( \\frac 1{2^a} \\cdot \\frac 12 \\cdot \\frac 1{2^b} \\cdot \\frac 12 \\cdot \\frac 1{2^c} \\cdots \\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac 12\\right)^5$, where $a,b,c \\ldots$ are all numbers $1-4$, since the blocks of H's can range from $1-4$ in length. The sum of all numbers of the form $(1/2)^a$ is $1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16=15/16$, so if there are n blocks of H's before the final five H's, the answer can be rewritten as the sum of all numbers of the form $\\frac 32\\left( \\left(\\frac {15}{16}\\right)^n \\cdot \\left(\\frac 12\\right)^n \\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac 1{32}\\right)=\\frac 3{64}\\left(\\frac{15}{32}\\right)^n$, where $n$ ranges from $0$ to $\\infty$, since that's how many blocks of H's there can be before the final five. This is an infinite geometric series whose sum is $\\frac{3/64}{1-(15/32)}=\\frac{3}{34}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{37}$."
