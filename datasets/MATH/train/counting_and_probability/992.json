    "solution": "The first condition is equivalent to the statement that $a = 4$ or $a = 5$. The second condition is equivalent to the statement that $d = 0$ or $d = 5$. Finally, the third condition is equivalent to the statement that the ordered pair $(b, c)$ is one of the pairs \\[(3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6),(5,6).\\]In total, $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6=\\boxed{24}$ four-digit numbers $N$ satisfying the conditions."
