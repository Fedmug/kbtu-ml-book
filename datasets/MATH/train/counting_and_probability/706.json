    "problem": "The probability it will rain on Saturday is $60\\%$, and the probability it will rain on Sunday is $25\\%$. If the probability of rain on a given day is independent of the weather on any other day, what is the probability it will rain on both days, expressed as a percent?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability that both of two independent events will occur is the product of the probabilities of each event.  Therefore, the probability that it will rain on both days is $(60\\%)(25\\%)=\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{20}$.  Multiplying the numerator and denominator of $3/20$ by $5$, we find that the probability that it will rain on both days is $\\boxed{15}$ percent."
