    "problem": "Our school's girls volleyball team has 14 players, including a set of 3 triplets: Alicia, Amanda, and Anna.  In how many ways can we choose 6 starters if exactly one of the triplets is in the starting lineup?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If exactly one of the triplets is in the lineup, we have 3 choices for which triplet to put in the starting lineup, and then 11 people to choose from for the remaining 5 spots.  So the answer is $3 \\times \\binom{11}{5} = 3 \\times 462 = \\boxed{1386}$."
