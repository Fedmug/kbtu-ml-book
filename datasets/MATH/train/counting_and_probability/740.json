    "solution": "Call a triangle with side length 1 toothpick a 1-triangle. The figure contains 10 upward-pointing 1-triangles and 6 downward-pointing 1-triangles. Removing a toothpick destroys at most one upward-pointing 1-triangle, so we must remove at least 10 toothpicks. Any triangle must have at least one horizontal toothpick, so if we remove all $\\boxed{10}$ horizontal toothpicks, no triangles remain. Since we have to remove at least 10, this is the minimum."
