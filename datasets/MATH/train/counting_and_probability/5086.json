    "solution": "Let us partition the set $\\{1,2,\\cdots,12\\}$ into $n$ numbers in $A$ and $12-n$ numbers in $B$,\nSince $n$ must be in $B$ and $12-n$ must be in $A$ ($n\\ne6$, we cannot partition into two sets of 6 because $6$ needs to end up somewhere, $n\\ne 0$ or $12$ either).\nWe have $\\dbinom{10}{n-1}$ ways of picking the numbers to be in $A$.\nSo the answer is $\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{11} \\dbinom{10}{n-1}\\right) - \\dbinom{10}{5}=2^{10}-252= \\boxed{772}$."
