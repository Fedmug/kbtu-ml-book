    "problem": "A club has 10 members, 5 boys and 5 girls.  Two of the members are chosen at random.  What is the probability that they are both girls?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ ways to choose two members of the group, and there are $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to choose two girls.  Therefore, the probability that two members chosen at random are girls is $\\dfrac{10}{45} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}}$."
