    "problem": "If the consecutive integers from $50$ to $1$ were written as $$5049484746...,$$ what would be the $67^{\\text{th}}$ digit to be written?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The first $66$ digits are $33$ two-digit integers.  The first $33$ integers written are $50$ to $18$.  Thus the $67^{\\text{th}}$ digit is the first digit of $17$, which is $\\boxed{1}$."
