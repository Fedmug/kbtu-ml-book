    "problem": "Bob rolls a fair six-sided die each morning. If Bob rolls a composite number, he eats sweetened cereal. If he rolls a prime number, he eats unsweetened cereal. If he rolls a 1, then he rolls again. In a non-leap year, what is the expected value of the difference between the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal and the number of days he eats sweetened cereal?

    "solution": "Bob is equally likely to end up rolling a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Three of these numbers are prime and two are composite, so there is a $\\frac{3}{5}$ chance he will eat unsweetened cereal and a $\\frac{2}{5}$ chance that he will eat sweetened cereal. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, so the expected value of the number of days Bob eats unsweetened cereal is $\\frac{3}{5}\\cdot365=219$ and the expected value of the number of days Bob eats sweetened cereal is $\\frac{2}{5}\\cdot365=146$. The difference between 219 days and 146 days is $\\boxed{73}$ days."
