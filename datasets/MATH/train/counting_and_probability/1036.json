    "solution": "Since we are told there are $20$ numbers in the first $4$ Rows, we want to find the $20^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number starting in Row 5. Since there are $10$ numbers in Row 5, and there are $12$ numbers in Row 6, the $20^{\\mathrm{th}}$ number if we start counting in Row 5 is located at the $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$ spot of Row 6, which is of course a $\\boxed{12}.$"
