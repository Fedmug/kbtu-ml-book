    "problem": "Bill can buy jags, jigs and jogs for $\\$1$, $\\$2$ and $\\$7$ each, respectively. What is the largest number of jogs he can purchase if he must buy at least one of each item and will spend exactly $\\$50$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Bill cannot purchase 7 jogs, because then he would only have one dollar left over and could not purchase at least one jag and one jig as well.  However, Bill can purchase $\\boxed{6}$ jogs if, for example, he also purchases 2 jags and 3 jigs."
