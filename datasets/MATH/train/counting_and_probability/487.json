    "problem": "In how many ways can 5 people be seated around a round table?  (Two seatings are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other.)",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $5!$ ways to place the people around the table, but this counts each valid arrangement 5 times (once for each rotation of the same arrangement).  The answer is $\\dfrac{5!}{5} = 4! = \\boxed{24}$."
