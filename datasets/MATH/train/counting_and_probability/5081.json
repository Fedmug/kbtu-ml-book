    "problem": "A game show offers a contestant three prizes A, B and C, each of which is worth a whole number of dollars from $$ 1$ to $$ 9999$ inclusive. The contestant wins the prizes by correctly guessing the price of each prize in the order A, B, C. As a hint, the digits of the three prices are given. On a particular day, the digits given were $1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3$. Find the total number of possible guesses for all three prizes consistent with the hint.\n",

    "solution": "Since we have three numbers, consider the number of ways we can put these three numbers together in a string of 7 digits. For example, if $A=113, B=13, C=31$, then the string is\n\\[1131331.\\]\nSince the strings have seven digits and three threes, there are $\\binom{7}{3}=35$ arrangements of all such strings.\nIn order to obtain all combination of A,B,C, we partition all the possible strings into 3 groups.\nLet's look at the example. We have to partition it into 3 groups with each group having at least 1 digit. In other words, we need to find the solution to\n\\[x+y+z=7, x,y,z>0.\\]\nThis gives us\n\\[\\binom{6}{2}=15\\]\nways by balls and urns. But we have counted the one with 5 digit numbers; that is, $(5,1,1),(1,1,5),(1,5,1)$.\nThus, each arrangement has\\[\\binom{6}{2}-3=12\\]ways per arrangement, and there are $12\\times35=\\boxed{420}$ ways."
