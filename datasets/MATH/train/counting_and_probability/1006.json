    "problem": "If $m$ and $n$ are odd integers, how many terms in the expansion of $(m+n)^6$ are odd?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "By the binomial theorem, $(m+n)^6$ expands as \\begin{align*}\n\\binom60m^6+\\binom61m^5n&+\\binom62m^4n^2+\\binom63m^3n^3\\\\\n&+\\binom64m^2n^4+\\binom65mn^5+\\binom66n^6.\n\\end{align*} Since $m$ and $n$ are odd, each of these terms is odd if and only if the binomial coefficient is odd. Since $\\binom60=\\binom66=1$, $\\binom61=\\binom65=6$, $\\binom62=\\binom64=15$, and $\\binom63=20$, exactly $\\boxed{4}$ of these terms are odd."
