    "problem": "A very bizarre weighted coin comes up heads with probability $\\frac12$, tails with probability $\\frac13$, and rests on its edge with probability $\\frac16$.  If it comes up heads, I win 1 dollar.  If it comes up tails, I win 3 dollars.  But if it lands on its edge, I lose 5 dollars.  What is the expected winnings from flipping this coin?  Express your answer as a dollar value, rounded to the nearest cent.",

    "solution": "The expected value is $E = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\times\\$1\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\times\\$3\\right) + \\left(\\dfrac{1}{6}\\times(-\\$5)\\right) = \\$\\dfrac{4}{6} =\\boxed{\\$\\dfrac23 \\approx \\$0.67}$."
