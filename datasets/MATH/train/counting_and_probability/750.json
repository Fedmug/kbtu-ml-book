    "problem": "Brent rolls a fair dodecahedral die with numbers $1,2,3,...,12$ on its faces. What is the expected number of digits in the number he obtains? Express your answer in a decimal.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are nine numbers with one digit: $1,2,...,9$, so the probability of selecting a one digit number is $\\frac{9}{12} =\\frac{3}{4}$. There are three numbers with two digits: $10,11,12$, so the probability of selecting a two digit number is $\\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The expected number of digits is therefore $E = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{1.25}$."
