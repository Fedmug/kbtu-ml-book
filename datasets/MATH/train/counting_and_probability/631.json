    "problem": "A board game spinner is divided into four regions labeled $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.  The probability of the arrow stopping on region $A$ is $\\frac{3}{8}$, the probability of it stopping in $B$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability of it stopping in region $C$ is equal to the probability of it stopping in region $D$. What is the probability of the arrow stopping in region $C$?  Express your answer as a common fraction.",

    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Let $x$ be the probability that we want. Since the sum of the four probabilities is 1, we have the equation $1 = \\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + x + x = \\frac{5}{8} + 2x$.  Solving the equation $1=\\frac{5}{8} + 2x$ gives $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{16}}$."
