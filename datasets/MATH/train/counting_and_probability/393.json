    "problem": "A bag has 4 red marbles, 5 white marbles, and 6 blue marbles.  Three marbles are drawn from the bag (without replacement).  What is the probability that they are all the same color?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We can have all red, all white, or all blue. Thus the answer is  \\begin{align*}\n&P(\\text{all red}) + P(\\text{all white}) + P(\\text{all blue}) \\\\\n&\\qquad = \\left(\\frac{4}{15}\\times\\frac{3}{14}\\times\\frac{2}{13}\\right) +\\left(\\frac{5}{15}\\times\\frac{4}{14}\\times\\frac{3}{13}\\right) \\\\\n&\\qquad\\qquad+\\left(\\frac{6}{15}\\times\\frac{5}{14}\\times\\frac{4}{13}\\right)=\\boxed{\\frac{34}{455}}. \\end{align*}"
