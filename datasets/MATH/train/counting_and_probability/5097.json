    "problem": "A $7\\times 1$ board is completely covered by $m\\times 1$ tiles without overlap; each tile may cover any number of consecutive squares, and each tile lies completely on the board. Each tile is either red, blue, or green. Let $N$ be the number of tilings of the $7\\times 1$ board in which all three colors are used at least once. For example, a $1\\times 1$ red tile followed by a $2\\times 1$ green tile, a $1\\times 1$ green tile, a $2\\times 1$ blue tile, and a $1\\times 1$ green tile is a valid tiling. Note that if the $2\\times 1$ blue tile is replaced by two $1\\times 1$ blue tiles, this results in a different tiling. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n",

    "solution": "Firstly, we consider how many different ways possible to divide the $7\\times 1$ board. We ignore the cases of 1 or 2 pieces since we need at least one tile of each color.\nThree pieces: $5+1+1$, $4+2+1$, $4+1+2$, etc, $\\dbinom{6}{2}=15$ ways in total (just apply stars and bars here)\nFour pieces: $\\dbinom{6}{3}=20$\nFive pieces: $\\dbinom{6}{4}=15$\nSix pieces: $\\dbinom{6}{5}=6$\nSeven pieces: $\\dbinom{6}{6}=1$\nSecondly, we use Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to consider how many ways to color them:\nThree pieces: $3^3-3\\times 2^3+3=6$\nFour pieces: $3^4-3\\times 2^4+3=36$\nFive pieces: $3^5-3\\times 2^5+3=150$\nSix pieces: $3^6-3\\times 2^6+3=540$\nSeven pieces: $3^7-3\\times 2^7+3=1806$\nFinally, we combine them together: $15\\times 6+20\\times 36+15\\times 150+6\\times 540+1\\times 1806= 8106$.\nSo the answer is $\\boxed{106}$."
