    "problem": "Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word MADAM.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $5!$. Then since the M's and the A's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ twice for the arrangements of M's and the arrangements of A's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{5!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{30}$."
