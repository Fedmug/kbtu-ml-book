    "problem": "A scanning code consists of a $7 \\times 7$ grid of squares, with some of its squares colored black and the rest colored white. There must be at least one square of each color in this grid of $49$ squares. A scanning code is called $\\textit{symmetric}$ if its look does not change when the entire square is rotated by a multiple of $90 ^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise around its center, nor when it is reflected across a line joining opposite corners or a line joining midpoints of opposite sides. What is the total number of possible symmetric scanning codes?\n$\\textbf{(A)} \\text{ 510} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)} \\text{ 1022} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 8190} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)} \\text{ 8192} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)} \\text{ 65,534}$\n",

    "solution": "Draw a $7 \\times 7$ square.\n$\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline K & J & H & G & H & J & K \\\\ \\hline J & F & E & D & E & F & J \\\\ \\hline H & E & C & B & C & E & H \\\\ \\hline G & D & B & A & B & D & G \\\\ \\hline H & E & C & B & C & E & H \\\\ \\hline J & F & E & D & E & F & J \\\\ \\hline K & J & H & G & H & J & K \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}$\nStart from the center and label all protruding cells symmetrically. (Note that \"I\" is left out of this labelling, so there are only 10 labels, not 11, as ending in K would suggest!)\nMore specifically, since there are $4$ given lines of symmetry ($2$ diagonals, $1$ vertical, $1$ horizontal) and they split the plot into $8$ equivalent sections, we can take just one-eighth and study it in particular. Each of these sections has $10$ distinct sub-squares, whether partially or in full. So since each can be colored either white or black, we choose $2^{10}=1024$ but then subtract the $2$ cases where all are white or all are black. That leaves us with $\\boxed{1022}$."
