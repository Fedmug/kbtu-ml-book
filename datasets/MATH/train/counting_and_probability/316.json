    "problem": "Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TOOT.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $4!$. Then since the T's and the O's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ twice for the arrangements of T's and the arrangement of O's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{4!}{2! \\times 2!} = \\boxed{6}$."
