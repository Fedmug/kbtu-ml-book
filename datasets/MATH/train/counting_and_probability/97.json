    "problem": "Molly flips a fair coin five times, and she is very surprised to flip a head each time. What is the probability she will flip a tail on her next flip of the coin? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "This problem refers to the property of coins and other trial-independent probability devices that we refer to as not having memory. In other words, the coin cannot respond in any way to how it landed on the previous 5 flips. It is still equally likely to be heads or tails on its next flip, so the probability is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$."
