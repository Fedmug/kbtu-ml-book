    "problem": "When flipping a fair coin, what is the probability that the first two flips are both heads? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability that any single flip comes up heads is $1/2$. Since the flips are independent, the probability that the first two flips are both heads is $1/2\\cdot1/2=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$."
