    "problem": "The probability of snow for each of the next three days is $\\frac{3}{4}$. What is the probability that it will not snow at all during the next three days? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The probability of it snowing on any one day is $\\frac{3}{4}$ so the probability of it not snowing on any one day is $\\frac{1}{4}$. So, the probability it not snowing on all three days is $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{64}}$."
