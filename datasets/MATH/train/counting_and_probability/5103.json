    "problem": "An urn contains $4$ green balls and $6$ blue balls. A second urn contains $16$ green balls and $N$ blue balls. A single ball is drawn at random from each urn. The probability that both balls are of the same color is $0.58$. Find $N$.\n",

    "solution": "First, we find the probability both are green, then the probability both are blue, and add the two probabilities. The sum should be equal to $0.58$.\nThe probability both are green is $\\frac{4}{10}\\cdot\\frac{16}{16+N}$, and the probability both are blue is $\\frac{6}{10}\\cdot\\frac{N}{16+N}$, so\\[\\frac{4}{10}\\cdot\\frac{16}{16+N}+\\frac{6}{10}\\cdot\\frac{N}{16+N}=\\frac{29}{50}\\]Solving this equation,\\[20\\left(\\frac{16}{16+N}\\right)+30\\left(\\frac{N}{16+N}\\right)=29\\]Multiplying both sides by $16+N$, we get\\[20\\cdot 16 + 30\\cdot N = 29(16+n)\\Rightarrow 320+30N=464+29N \\Rightarrow N = \\boxed{144}\\]"
