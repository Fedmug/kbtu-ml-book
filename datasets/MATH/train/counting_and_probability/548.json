    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Each outcome of rolling a 6-sided die has probability $\\frac16$, and the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  So the expected value is $$ \\frac16(1) + \\frac16(2) + \\frac16(3) + \\frac16(4) + \\frac16(5) + \\frac16(6) = \\frac{21}{6} = \\boxed{3.5}. $$"
