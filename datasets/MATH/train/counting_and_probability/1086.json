    "problem": "Jenna is at a fair with four friends. They all want to ride the roller coaster, but only three people can fit in a car. How many different groups of three can the five of them make?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "If there are $5$ people, we can arrange then in $5\\cdot 4\\cdot 3 = 60$ ways. Since we don't care about order, we've overcounted. There are $3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$ ways to arrange $3$ people, so our answer is\n$$\n\\frac{60}{6} = \\boxed{10}.\n$$Alternatively, the number of groups of three that five people can make (without regard to the order the groups) is $\\binom{5}{3}=\\frac{5!}{3!2!}=\\boxed{10}$."
