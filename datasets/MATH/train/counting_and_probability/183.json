    "problem": "Alli rolls a standard $6$-sided die twice. What is the probability of rolling integers that differ by $2$ on her first two rolls? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "We have to use a little bit of casework to solve this problem because some numbers on the die have a positive difference of $2$ when paired with either of two other numbers (for example, $3$ with either $1$ or $5$) while other numbers will only have a positive difference of $2$ when paired with one particular number (for example, $2$ with $4$).\n\nIf the first roll is a $1,$ $2,$ $5,$ or $6,$ there is only one second roll in each case that will satisfy the given condition, so there are $4$ combinations of rolls that result in two integers with a positive difference of $2$ in this case. If, however, the first roll is a $3$ or a $4,$ in each case there will be two rolls that satisfy the given condition- $1$ or $5$ and $2$ or $6,$ respectively. This gives us another $4$ successful combinations for a total of $8.$\n\nSince there are $6$ possible outcomes when a die is rolled, there are a total of $6\\cdot6=36$ possible combinations for two rolls, which means our probability is $\\dfrac{8}{36}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{9}}.$\n\nOR\n\nWe can also solve this problem by listing all the ways in which the two rolls have a positive difference of $2:$ $$(6,4), (5,3), (4,2), (3,1), (4,6), (3,5), (2,4), (1,3).$$  So, we have $8$ successful outcomes out of $6\\cdot 6 = 36$ possibilities, which produces a probability of $8/36 = 2/9.$"
