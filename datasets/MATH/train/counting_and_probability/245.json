    "problem": "What is the coefficient of $x^4$ in the expansion of $(1-2x^2)^5$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Using the binomial theorem, we find that the $x^4=(x^2)^2$ term of the expansion is $\\binom{5}{2}(1)^3(-2x^2)^2=10(4x^4)=40x^4$.  Thus, the desired coefficient is $\\boxed{40}$."
