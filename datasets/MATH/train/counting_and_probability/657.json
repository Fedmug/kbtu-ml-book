    "problem": "John has 12 marbles of different colors, including one red, one green, and one blue marble. In how many ways can he choose 4 marbles, if exactly one of the chosen marbles is red, green, or blue?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 3 ways for John to decide which of the red, green, and blue marbles to choose. After he has chosen one of them, he must choose 3 marbles from the other 9. There are $\\binom{9}{3}=84$ ways for him to do this. The total number of valid ways for John to choose four marbles is $3\\cdot 84=\\boxed{252}$."
