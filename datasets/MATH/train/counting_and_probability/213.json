    "solution": "We denote a path from $A$ to $B$ by writing the labeled points visited, such as $A$-$C$-$B$ (first going to $C$ then to $B$).\n\nCase 1: Path ends in $C$-$B$.  There are clearly four such paths, which we can determine systematically; $A$-$C$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$C$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$F$-$C$-$B$, and $A$-$D$-$E$-$F$-$C$-$B$.\n\nCase 2: Path ends in $F$-$B$.  The possible paths are easy to determine systematically as $A$-$C$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$C$-$D$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$C$-$D$-$E$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$C$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$F$-$B$, $A$-$D$-$E$-$F$-$B$, yielding 6 possible paths.\n\nTherefore there are a total of $\\boxed{10}$ such paths."
