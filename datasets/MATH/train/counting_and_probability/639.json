    "solution": "Let $x$ denote the common sum of the numbers on each line. Then $4x$ gives the sum of all the numbers $A, B, \\ldots, J,$ but with $J$ counted four times. Since the sum of the numbers on the octagon must be $1 + 2 + \\dots + 9 = 45,$ we have $4x = 45 + 3J$ (where $J$ represents the number written at that vertex). Thus, $45 + 3J$ must be a multiple of $4$, which occurs exactly when $J \\in \\{1, 5, 9\\}.$\n\nIf $J = 1,$ then $4x = 45 + 3J = 48,$ so $x = 12.$ It follows that the sum of each pair of diametrically opposite vertices is $12 - 1 = 11,$ so we must pair up the numbers $\\{2, 9\\}$, $\\{3, 8\\}$, $\\{4, 7\\}$, and $\\{5, 6\\}.$ There are $4!$ ways to assign the four pairs, and then $2^4$ ways to assign the two numbers in each individual pair. Therefore, in the case $J = 1$, there are $4! \\cdot 2^4 = 384$ ways to label the vertices.\n\nThe cases $J = 5$ and $J = 9$ are the same, and also produce $384$ valid ways. Thus, the total number of ways to label the vertices is $3 \\cdot 384 = \\boxed{1152}.$"
