    "problem": "Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TARTAR.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First we count the arrangements if all the letters are unique, which is $6!$. Then since the T's, A's, and the R's are not unique, we divide by $2!$ thrice for the arrangements of T's, A's, and R's, for an answer of $\\dfrac{6!}{2! \\times 2! \\times 2!} = \\dfrac{720}{8} = \\boxed{90}$."
