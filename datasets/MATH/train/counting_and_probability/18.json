    "problem": "What is the value of $99^3 + 3(99^2) + 3(99) + 1$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "The given expression is the expansion of $(99+1)^3$.  In general, the cube $(x+y)^3$ is \\[(x+y)^3=1x^3+3x^2y+3xy^2+1y^3.\\]   The first and last terms in the given expression are cubes and the middle two terms both have coefficient 3, giving us a clue that this is a cube of a binomial and can be written in the form \\[(x+y)^3\\]In this case, $x=99$ and $y=1$, so our answer is\\[(99+1)^3\\ = 100^3 = \\boxed{1,\\!000,\\!000}\\]"
