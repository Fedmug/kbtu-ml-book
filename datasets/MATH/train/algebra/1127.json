    "problem": "A geometric sequence of positive integers is formed for which the first term is 2 and the fifth term is 162. What is the sixth term of the sequence?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the geometric sequence have common ratio $r$. We know that $2\\cdot r^4=162$, or $r=3$. Thus, the sixth term is $2 \\cdot r^5 = 2 \\cdot 3^5 = \\boxed{486}$."
