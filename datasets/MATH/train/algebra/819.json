    "problem": "Find the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies the equation $|3x+7|=26$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can split the expression $|3x+7|=26$ into two separate cases: $3x+7=26$ and $3x+7=-26$. For the first case, solving for $x$ would give us $x=\\frac{26-7}{3}=\\frac{19}{3}$. For the second case, we would get $x=\\frac{-26-7}{3}=\\frac{-33}{3}=-11$. Therefore, $x=\\frac{19}{3}$ and $x=-11$ both satisfy the equation. Since the problem asks for the smallest value of $x$, our solution is $\\boxed{-11}$."
