    "solution": "We solve the equation $f(x) = -5$ on the domains $x < -2$ and $x \\ge -2.$\n\nIf $x < -2,$ then $f(x) = 2x + 7,$ so we want to solve $2x + 7 = -5.$ The solution is $x = -6,$ which satisfies $x < -2.$\n\nIf $x \\ge -2,$ then $f(x) = -x^2 - x + 1,$ so we want to solve $-x^2 - x + 1 = -5.$ This equation simplifies to $x^2 + x - 6 = 0,$ which factors as $(x - 2)(x + 3) = 0.$ The solutions are $x = 2$ and $x = -3,$ but only $x = 2$ satisfies $x \\ge -2.$\n\nTherefore, the solutions are $-6$ and $2,$ and their sum is $(-6) + 2 = \\boxed{-4}.$"
