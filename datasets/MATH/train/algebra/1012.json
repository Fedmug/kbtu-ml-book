    "problem": "The points $(9, -5)$ and $(-3, -1)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of a circle. What is the sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The center of the circle is located at the midpoint of any diameter. Thus, the center of the circle is $\\left(\\frac{9+(-3)}{2}, \\frac{(-5)+(-1)}{2}\\right) = (3, -3)$. The sum of the coordinates of the center of the circle is therefore $3 + (-3) = \\boxed{0}$."
