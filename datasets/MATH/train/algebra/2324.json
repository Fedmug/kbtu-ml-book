    "problem": "Cedric has deposited $\\$12,\\!000$ into an account that pays $5\\%$ interest compounded annually.\n\nDaniel has deposited $\\$12,\\!000$ into an account that pays $7\\%$ simple annual interest.\n\nIn $15$ years Cedric and Daniel compare their respective balances. To the nearest dollar, what is the positive difference between their balances?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We may find Cedric's balance by simply finding $\\$12,\\!000(1 + 0.05)^{15} \\approx \\$24,\\!947.14.$\n\nWe may find Daniel balance by finding $\\$12,\\!000(1 + 15 \\cdot 0.07) \\approx \\$24,\\!600.$\n\nTherefore, the difference between their balances is roughly $\\$24,\\!947.14 - \\$24,\\!600 \\approx \\boxed{\\$347}.$"
