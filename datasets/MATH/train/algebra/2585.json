    "problem": "A particular novel contains $40,\\!000$ words. If the author completed the novel in $80$ hours, on average how many words per hour did she write?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We find the average words per hour by dividing the total words by the total hours. $$\\frac{40,\\!000\\text{ words}}{80\\text{ hours}}=\\frac{4,\\!000}{8}=\\frac{40\\cdot100}{8}=5\\cdot100=\\boxed{500} \\text{ words per hour}$$"
