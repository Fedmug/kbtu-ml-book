    "problem": "Given that $f(x) = x^k$ where $k > 0$, what is the range of $f(x)$ on the interval $[1, \\infty)$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because $k > 0$, $f(x)$ is increasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. We see that $f(1) = 1^k = 1$, and as $x$ increases, $f(x) = x^k$ increases without bound.  Hence, on the interval $[1,\\infty)$, $f(x)$ takes on all values greater than or equal to 1, which means the range of $f(x)$ is $\\boxed{[1,\\infty)}$."
