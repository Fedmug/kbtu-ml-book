    "problem": "Consider the lines \\begin{align*}\ny&=3x+5 \\\\ 2y&=4x+5 \\\\ 3y&=9x-2 \\\\ 2y&=x-3 \\\\ 4y&=x-5.\n\\end{align*}Let's say that a pair of lines is $\\emph{good}$ if the two lines are either parallel or perpendicular to each other.  Among all the pairs of lines shown, how many pairs are good?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We find the slope for each line. The slopes are $\\frac31=3$, $\\frac42=2$, $\\frac93=3$, $\\frac12$, and $\\frac14$.\nParallel lines have the same slope, therefore lines $a$ and $c$ are parallel. Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. None of the slopes above are negative reciprocals, therefore there are no perpendicular lines. There are $1+0=\\boxed{1}$ pairs of lines that are parallel or perpendicular."
