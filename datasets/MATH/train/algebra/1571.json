    "problem": "Let $k, a_2, a_3$ and $k, b_2, b_3$ be nonconstant geometric sequences with different common ratios.  If  \\[a_3-b_3=2(a_2-b_2),\\]then what is the sum of the common ratios of the two sequences?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the common ratio of the first sequence be $p$ and the common ratio of the second sequence be $r$.  Then the equation becomes\n\n$$kp^2-kr^2=2(kp-kr)$$Dividing both sides by $k$ (since the sequences are nonconstant, no term can be $0$), we get\n\n$$p^2-r^2=2(p-r)$$The left side factors as $(p-r)(p+r)$.  Since $p\\neq r$, we can divide by $p-r$ to get\n\n$$p+r=\\boxed{2}$$"
