    "problem": "The number 21 is the sum of two consecutive integers 10 and 11. What is the largest number of positive, consecutive integers whose sum is 21?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, we see that $1+2+3+4+5+6=21$.  If a number is the sum of seven or more consecutive positive integers, then the number must be at least $1 + 2 + \\dots + 7 = 7 \\cdot 8/2 = 28$, so $\\boxed{6}$ is the largest number of consecutive integers we can use."
