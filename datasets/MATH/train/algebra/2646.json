    "problem": "One more than the reciprocal of a particular number is $\\frac{7}{3}$. What is the original number expressed as a common fraction?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Letting the original number be $x$, we must have $$1+\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{7}{3}.$$ Subtracting 1 from both sides gives $$\\dfrac{1}{x} = \\dfrac{4}{3}.$$ Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives  $x=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}.$"
