    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The first function has a minimum value of 0, while the second has a maximum of 0.  Also, their zeros occur at different spots (in the former case, at $x = -\\frac{5}{2}$, in the latter, at $x = \\frac{2}{3}$).  Hence their graphs do not intersect, so our answer is $\\boxed{0}.$"
