    "problem": "What is the sum of the squares of the coefficients of $4(x^4 + 3x^2 + 1)$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We simply distribute the $4$ to get $4x^4 + 12x^2 + 4.$ Then, the sum of the squares of the coefficients is $4^2 + 12^2 + 4^2 = \\boxed{176}.$\n\nNote that the constant term $4$ is indeed a coefficient: it is the coefficient of $x^0$."
