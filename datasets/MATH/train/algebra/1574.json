    "problem": "The terms $140, a, \\frac{45}{28}$ are the first, second and third terms, respectively, of a geometric sequence. If $a$ is positive, what is the value of $a$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the common ratio of the geometric sequence be $r$. We have the equations $140\\cdot r = a$ and $a \\cdot r = \\frac{45}{28}$. In the first equation, we solve for $r$ to get $r=\\frac{a}{140}$, and substitute this into the second equation to eliminate $r$, resulting in $a \\cdot \\frac{a}{140} = \\frac{45}{28}$, or $a = \\boxed{15}$."
