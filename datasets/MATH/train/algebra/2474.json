    "problem": "The fifth term of an arithmetic sequence is $11$. If the difference between two consecutive terms is $1$, what is the product of the first two terms?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Simply back up from $11$. Since $11$ is the fifth term, the first term will be $11 - 4 \\cdot 1 = 7$, and the second term will be $11 - 3\\cdot 1 = 8$. So the answer is $7 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{56}$."
