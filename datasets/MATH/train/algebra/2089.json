    "problem": "If 15 bahs are equal to 24 rahs, and 9 rahs are equal in value to 15 yahs, how many bahs are equal in value to 1000 yahs?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Five yahs are equivalent to 3 rahs, so $5\\cdot 200=1000$ yahs are equivalent to $3\\cdot 200=600$ rahs.  Eight rahs are equivalent to 5 bahs, so $8\\cdot 75=600$ rahs are equivalent to $5\\cdot75=\\boxed{375}$ bahs."
