    "problem": "The quadratic $-6x^2+36x+216$ can be written in the form $a(x+b)^2+c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. What is $a+b+c$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We complete the square.\n\nFactoring $-6$ out of the quadratic and linear terms gives $-6x^2 + 36x = -6(x^2-6x)$.\n\nSince $(x-3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9$, we can write $$-6(x-3)^2 = -6x^2 + 36x - 54.$$This quadratic agrees with the given $-6x^2 + 36x + 216$ in all but the constant term. We can write\n\n\\begin{align*}\n-6x^2 + 36x + 216 &= (-6x^2 + 36x - 54) + 270 \\\\\n&= -6(x-3)^2 + 270.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $a=-6$, $b=-3$, $c=270$, and $a+b+c = -6-3+270 = \\boxed{261}$."
