    "problem": "Brenda is going from $(-4,5)$ to $(5,-4)$, but she needs to stop by the origin on the way. How far does she have to travel?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "There are two segments of Brenda's trip: from $(-4,5)$ to $(0,0)$, and from $(0,0)$ to $(5,-4)$. Using the distance formula, the total distance is  \\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt{(-4-0)^2+(5-0)^2}&+\\sqrt{(5-0)^2+(-4-0)^2}\\\\\n&=\\sqrt{16+25}+\\sqrt{25+16}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2\\sqrt{41}}.\n\\end{align*}"
