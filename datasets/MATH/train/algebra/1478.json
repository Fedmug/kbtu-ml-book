    "problem": "If $9s+5t=108$ and $s$ is two less than $t$, what is $t$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we begin by solving the system of equations \\begin{align*}\n9s+5t&=108, \\\\\nt-2&=s.\n\\end{align*}Making the substitution for $s$ from the second equation to the first, we get $9(t-2)+5t=108$, which simplifies to $14t-18=108$. Solving for $t$, we find that $t=\\frac{108+18}{14}=\\boxed{9}$."
