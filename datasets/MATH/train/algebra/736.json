    "problem": "The greatest integer function of $x$ is expressed as $[x]$ and is defined to be the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. Find $[\\pi - 4]$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because $\\pi$ is greater than $3$ but less than $4$,\n\n$-1<\\pi - 4<0$.  Therefore, $[\\pi - 4]$ is $\\boxed{-1}$"
