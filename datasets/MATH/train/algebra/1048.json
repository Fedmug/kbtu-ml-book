    "problem": "What is the sum of all of the solutions of the equation $\\frac{4x}{20}=\\frac{5}{x}$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Rewrite $\\frac{4}{20}$ as $\\frac{1}{5}$ and multiply both sides by $5x$ to obtain $x^2=25$.  The solutions of this equation are $\\pm\\sqrt{25}=\\pm5$, and their sum is $(-5)+5=\\boxed{0}$."
