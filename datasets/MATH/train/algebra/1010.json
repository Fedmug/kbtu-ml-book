    "solution": "Since $18 - 14 = 4$, the common difference in the first column of squares is 4, so the number above 14 is $14 - 4 = 10$, and the number above 10 is $10 - 4 = 6$.  This is also the fourth number in the row, so the common difference in the row is $(6 - 21)/3 = -5$.\n\nThen the seventh (and last) number in the row is $21 - 5 \\cdot 6 = -9$.  In the second column, the common difference is $[(-17) - (-9)]/4 = -2$, so $N = -9 - (-2) = \\boxed{-7}$."
