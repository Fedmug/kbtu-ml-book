    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Begin by noticing that $256=16^2$.  We can then repeatedly apply a difference of squares factorization: \\begin{align*}\nx^8-256&=(x^4+16)(x^4-16)\\\\\n&=(x^4+16)(x^2+4)(x^2-4)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{(x^4+16)(x^2+4)(x+2)(x-2)}\\\\\n\\end{align*}"
