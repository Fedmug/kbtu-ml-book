    "problem": "What is the value of $\\displaystyle\\frac{109^2-100^2}{9}$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The key to this problem is noticing that $109^2 - 100^2$ factors into $(109+100)(109-100)$. So, our fraction becomes $\\frac{(109+100)(109-100)}{9} = \\frac{209 \\cdot 9}{9}$, which simplifies to $\\boxed{209}$."
