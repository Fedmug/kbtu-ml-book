    "problem": "The sum of two numbers is $30$. Their difference is $4$. What is the larger of the two numbers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x,y$ be the larger and smaller numbers, respectively. We have $x+y=30$ and $x-y=4$. Thus: $x=\\frac{1}{2}((x+y)+(x-y))=\\frac{1}{2}(30+4)=\\boxed{17}$."
