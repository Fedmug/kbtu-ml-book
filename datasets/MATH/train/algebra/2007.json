    "problem": "What integer is closest to the value of $\\sqrt[3]{6^3+8^3}$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $\\sqrt[3]{6^3 + 8^3} = \\sqrt[3]{216 + 512} = \\sqrt[3]{728}$. To find the integer closest to this, we note that $8^3 = 512$, $9^3= 729$, and $10^3 =1000$, so $\\sqrt[3]{728}$ is very close to $\\boxed{9}$."
