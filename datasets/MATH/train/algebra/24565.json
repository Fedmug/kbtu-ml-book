    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We want to find the common difference, say $d$. We observe that \\begin{align*}\na_{101}& + a_{102} + \\dots + a_{200} \\\\\n&= (a_1 + 100d)\n+ (a_2+ 100d) + \\ldots + (a_{100} + 100d) \\\\\n&= a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{100} + 10000d.\n\\end{align*}Thus $200=100+10000d$  and  $d=\\frac{100}{10000}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{100}}$."
