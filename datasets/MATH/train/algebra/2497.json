    "problem": "A quadrilateral has vertices at $(0,1)$, $(3,4)$, $(4,3)$ and $(3,0)$. Its perimeter can be expressed in the form $a\\sqrt2+b\\sqrt{10}$ with $a$ and $b$ integers. What is the sum of $a$ and $b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula to find the length of each side.\n\nThe distance from $(0, 1)$ to $(3, 4)$ is $\\sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (4 - 1)^2} = 3\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe distance from $(3, 4)$ to $(4, 3)$ is $\\sqrt{(4 - 3)^2 + (3 - 4)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe distance from $(4, 3)$ to $(3, 0)$ is $\\sqrt{(3 - 4)^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \\sqrt{10}$.\n\nThe distance from $(3, 0)$ to $(0, 1)$ is $\\sqrt{(0 - 3)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{10}$.\n\nAdding all of these side lengths, we find that the perimeter is $4\\sqrt{2} + 2\\sqrt{10}$. Thus, our final answer is $4 + 2 = \\boxed{6}$."
