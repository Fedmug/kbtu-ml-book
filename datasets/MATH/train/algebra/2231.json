    "problem": "The expression $\\frac{x-3}{4x}$ is equal to zero for what value of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The fraction is equal to zero if the numerator is equal to zero. Thus, $x-3=0$, so $x=\\boxed{3}$. (Note that at this $x$ value, the denominator is not equal to zero.)"
