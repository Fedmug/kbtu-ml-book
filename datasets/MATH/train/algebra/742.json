    "problem": "The points $(x, y)$ represented in this table lie on a straight line. The point $(28, t)$ lies on the same line. What is the value of $t?$ \\begin{tabular}{c|c}\n$x$ & $y$ \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 7 \\\\\n3 & 13 \\\\\n5 & 19 \\\\\n\\end{tabular}",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Looking at the table, we see that increasing $x$ by two results in an increase in $y$ of $6.$ Thus for every increase in $x$ of $1,$ $y$ increases by $3.$ If $x = 1$ gives $y = 7,$ then $x = 28 = 1 + 27$ gives $y = 7 + 27\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{88}.$"
