    "problem": "The sum of two numbers is $45$. Their difference is $3$. What is the lesser of the two numbers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x,y$ be the larger and smaller numbers, respectively. We have $x+y=45$ and $x-y=3$. Thus: $y=\\frac{1}{2}((x+y)-(x-y))=\\frac{1}{2}(45-3)=\\boxed{21}$."
