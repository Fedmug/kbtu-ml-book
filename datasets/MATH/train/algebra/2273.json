    "problem": "The sum of two numbers is 22. Their difference is 4. What is the greater of the two numbers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the two numbers be $x$ and $y$, where $x>y$. We wish to find $x$. The problem can be rewritten as the system of equations: \\begin{align*}\nx+y&= 22\\\\\nx-y&= 4\n\\end{align*} Adding these gives: \\begin{align*}\n2x &= 26\\\\\nx &=\\boxed{13}.\n\\end{align*}"
