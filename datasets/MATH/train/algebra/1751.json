    "problem": "Find the $x$-intercept point of the line $3x+5y=20$. Provide your answer as an ordered pair.  Express the $x$ and $y$ coordinates as common fractions as needed.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Letting $y=0$ in $3x+5y=20$ gives $3x=20$, so the $x$-coordinate of the $x$-intercept is $20/3$.  So, the $x$-intercept is $\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{20}{3},0\\right)}$."
