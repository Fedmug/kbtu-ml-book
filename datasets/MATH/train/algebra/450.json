    "problem": "On an algebra test, there were $5x$ problems. Lucky Lacy missed $x$ of them. What percent of the problems did she get correct?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If Lucky Lacy missed $x$ out of $5x$ problems, then she must have gotten $5x-x=4x$ of them correct. Therefore, the percentage of problems that Lacy got correct is  $\\frac{4x}{5x}=\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{80}{100}=\\boxed{80 \\%}$."
