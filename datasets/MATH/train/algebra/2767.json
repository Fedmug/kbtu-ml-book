    "problem": "Given two real numbers $1<p<q$ so that $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ and $pq = \\frac{9}{2}$, what is $q$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Solving $pq = \\frac{9}{2}$ for $p$ we see that $p = \\frac{9}{2q}$. Plugging this into $\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1$ we then get \\[ \\frac{2q}{9} + \\frac{1}{q} = 1 \\Rightarrow 2q^2 - 9q +9 = 0 .\\] Applying the quadratic equation we then see that  \\[ q = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{81-72}}{4} = \\frac{9 \\pm 3}{4} .\\] Now, the smaller root corresponds to $p$ and the larger to $q$, so we see that $\\boxed{q = 3}$."
