    "problem": "The endpoints of a line segment are (2, 3) and (8, 15). What is the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The midpoint of a line segment with endpoints $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$ is $\\left(\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThus, the midpoint of this line segment is $\\left(\\frac{2+8}{2}, \\frac{3+15}{2} \\right)$, which simplifies to $(5,9)$. Thus, the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint is $\\boxed{14}$."
