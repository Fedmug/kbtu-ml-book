    "problem": "The graph of the line $x+y=b$ intersects the line segment from $(2,5)$ to $(4,9)$ at its midpoint. What is the value of $b$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the line $x+y=b$ intersects the midpoint, which is: $$\\left(\\frac{2+4}{2},\\frac{5+9}{2}\\right)=(3,7)$$This point lies on the line $x+y=b$, so we must have $3+7=b$. Thus, $b=\\boxed{10}$."
