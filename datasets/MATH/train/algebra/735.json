    "problem": "A ball bounces back up $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the height from which it falls. If the ball is dropped from a height of $243$ cm, after how many bounces does the ball first rise less than $30$ cm?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If you call the number of bounces $b$, then this problem can be phrased as: what is the minimum $b$, such that $243\\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^b < 30 \\rightarrow \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^b < \\frac{30}{243}$, at which point you can take the logarithm of both sides and solve for it exactly, but given that you can use your calculator, it's much easier to just multiply $\\frac{2}{3}$ with itself repeatedly until the product is less than $\\frac{30}{243}$.  Regardless of how you do it, you will get $b = \\boxed{6}$."
