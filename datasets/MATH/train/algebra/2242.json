    "problem": "The bacteria in a jar triple every 20 seconds. After three minutes, there are 275,562 bacteria in the jar. How many were in the jar at the beginning of the experiment?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "After three minutes, the number of bacteria $n$ has tripled $9$ times.  This gives us the equation $n \\cdot 3^9 = 275,\\!562$, or $19,\\!683n=275,\\!562$, so $n = \\boxed{14}$"
