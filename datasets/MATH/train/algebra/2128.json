    "problem": "The sequence $6075, 2025, 675 \\ldots$, is made by repeatedly dividing by 3. How many integers are in this sequence?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$6075$ can be factored as $3^55^2$ - thus, since we are dividing by 3 repeatedly, there will be $\\boxed{6}$ integer terms."
