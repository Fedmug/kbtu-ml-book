    "solution": "The vertex form of a parabolic equation is $y=a(x-h)^2+k$. Since we are given that the vertex is at $(2,-4)$, we know that $h=2$ and $k=-4$. Plugging that into our equation gives $y=a(x-2)^2-4$. Now, substituting the other given point $(4,12)$ into the equation to solve for $a$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n12&=a(4-2)^2-4\\\\\n16&=a(2)^2\\\\\n16&=4a\\\\\n4&=a\n\\end{align*} So the equation for the graphed parabola is $y=4(x-2)^2-4$. The zeros of the quadratic occur when $y=0$, so plugging that value into the equation to solve for $x$, we have $0=4(x-2)^2-4 \\Rightarrow (x-2)^2=1$. Taking the square root of both sides yields $x-2=\\pm 1$, so $x=3$ or $x=1$. Thus, $m=3$ and $n=1$, so $m-n=3-1=\\boxed{2}$."
