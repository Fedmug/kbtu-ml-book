    "problem": "Solve for $x$: $\\frac{5x}{(x+3)} - \\frac3{(x+3)} = \\frac1{(x+3)}$",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, we combine the fraction on the left to give $\\frac{5x-3}{x+3} = \\frac{1}{x+3}$.  Then, multiplying both sides by $x+3$ gets rid of the denominators and leaves $5x-3 = 1$.  Adding 3 to both sides gives $5x=4$, so $x = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{5}}$."
