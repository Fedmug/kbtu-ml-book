    "problem": "Piravena must make a trip from $A$ to $B,$ then from $B$ to $C,$ then from $C$ to $A.$ Each of these three parts of the trip is made entirely by bus or entirely by airplane. The cities form a right-angled triangle as shown, with $C$ a distance of $3000\\text{ km}$ from $A$ and with $B$ a distance of $3250\\text{ km}$ from $A.$ To take a bus, it costs Piravena $\\$0.15$ per kilometer. To take an airplane, it costs her a $\\$100$ booking fee, plus $\\$0.10$ per kilometer. [asy]\npair A, B, C;\nC=(0,0);\nB=(0,1250);\nA=(3000,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--A);\nlabel(\"A\", A, SE);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SW);\nlabel(\"3000 km\", (A+C)/2, S);\nlabel(\"3250 km\", (A+B)/2, NE);\ndraw((0,125)--(125,125)--(125,0));\n[/asy]  To begin her trip she flew from $A$ to $B.$ Determine the cost to fly from $A$ to $B.$",

    "solution": "The cost to fly is $\\$0.10$ per kilometer plus a $\\$100$ booking fee. To fly $3250\\text{ km}$ from $A$ to $B,$ the cost is $$3250\\times 0.10 + 100=325+100=\\boxed{\\$425}.$$"
