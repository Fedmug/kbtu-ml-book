    "problem": "A tree doubled its height every year until it reached a height of 32 feet at the end of 6 years. What was the height of the tree, in feet, at the end of 3 years?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Going backwards, we see that the tree was $32/2 = 16$ feet at the end of 5 years, $16/2 = 8$ feet at the end of 4 years, and $8/2 = \\boxed{4 \\text{ feet}}$ at the end of 3 years."
