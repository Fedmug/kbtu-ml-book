    "problem": "What is the sum of the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2-5x+5=9$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, we have $x^2 - 5x - 4 = 0$.  The sum of the roots of this quadratic is negative its linear coefficient, which is $\\boxed{5}$.\n\n(The above is true because if a quadratic has roots $r$ and $s$, we have $(x-r)(x-s) = x^2 - (r+s)+rs = 0$.)"
