    "solution": "Recall that for an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the sum of roots is equal to $-b/a$ and the product of the roots is equal to $c/a$.\n\nSo, we can write the set of equations \\begin{align*}\n3 - \\frac{4}{3} &= \\frac{5}{k} \\\\\n-4 &= \\frac{-12}{k}\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe second equation tells us immediately that $k = \\boxed{3}$."
