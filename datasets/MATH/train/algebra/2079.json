    "problem": "Quantities $r$ and $s$ vary inversely. When $r$ is $1200,$ $s$ is $0.35.$ What is the value of $s$ when $r$ is $2400$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest thousandths.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $r$ and $s$ vary inversely, $r\\cdot s$ must be a constant.  Thus $1200\\cdot .35 = s \\cdot 2400 \\Rightarrow s = \\frac{.35}2 = \\boxed{.175}$."
