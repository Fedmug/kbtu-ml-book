    "problem": "If $4^6=8^n$, what is $n$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(2^2)^6=(2^3)^n$, which simplifies to $2^{12}=2^{3n}$. Setting the exponents equal to each other, $12=3n$, or $n=\\frac{12}{3}=\\boxed{4}$."
