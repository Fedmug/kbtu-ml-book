    "problem": "At time $t=0,$ a ball is thrown downward at 24 feet per second from a height of 160 feet above the ground.  The equation $h = -16t^2 - 24t +160$ describes the height (in feet) of the ball. In how many seconds will the ball hit the ground? Express your answer as a decimal.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Setting $h$ to zero, we find the following: \\begin{align*}\n0& = -16t^2 - 24t + 160\\\\\n& = 2t^2 +3t - 20\\\\\n& = (2t-5)(t+4)\\\\\n\\end{align*}The negative value of $t$ is extraneous, so we are left with $t=\\boxed{2.5}$"
