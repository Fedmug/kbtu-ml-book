    "problem": "Two numbers have a difference of 3 and a sum of 31. What is the larger of the two numbers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the numbers be $x$ and $y$.  We have $x+y=31$ and $x-y=3$.  Summing these equations, we get $2x=34$, or $x=17$.  Since $x-y$ is positive, this is the larger number, so the answer is $\\boxed{17}$."
