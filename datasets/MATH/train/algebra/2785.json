    "problem": "The values of $x$ and $y$ are always positive, and $x^2$ and $y$ vary inversely. If $y$ is 10 when $x$ is 2, then find $x$ when $y$ is 4000.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $x^2$ and $y$ are inversely proportional, their product is constant.  Thus $$2^2 \\cdot 10 = x^2 \\cdot 4000 \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{10}}.$$"
