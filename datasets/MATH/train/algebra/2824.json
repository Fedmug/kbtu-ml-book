    "problem": "Let $a\\star b = ab+2b-a$. If $5\\star x = 37$, find the value of $x$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $5\\star x = 5x+2x-5=37$. Combining like terms and adding $5$ to both sides, we have $7x=42$. Dividing by $7$ on both sides, we see that $x=\\boxed{6}$."
