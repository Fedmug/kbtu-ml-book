    "problem": "What is the $x$-intercept of the line perpendicular to the line defined by $3x-2y = 6$ and whose $y$-intercept is 2?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "By subtracting $3x$ and dividing both sides by $-2$ we get $y = \\frac 32 x - 3$ meaning this line has slope $\\frac{3}{2}$ and any line perpendicular to it has slope $-\\frac{2}{3}$.  Using the slope-intercept form of a line we get that the equation of the line perpendicular to it with $y$-intercept of 2 is $y = -\\frac{2}{3} x + 2$.  We find the $x$-intercept by letting $y = 0$ which gives $x = \\boxed{3}$."
