    "problem": "For $y=\\frac{x+2}{5x-7}$, at what $x$-value is there a vertical asymptote?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "There is a vertical asymptote where the denominator equals 0 and thus $y$ is undefined. For the denominator to equal 0, we have $5x-7=0\\Rightarrow x=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{5}}$."
