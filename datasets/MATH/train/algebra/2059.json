    "problem": "The value of $\\log_{10}{17}$ is between the consecutive integers $a$ and $b$.  Find $a+b$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can have $\\log_{10}10=1$ and $\\log_{10}100=2$.  Since $\\log_{10}x$ increases as $x$ increases, we know that $\\log_{10}10<\\log_{10}17<\\log_{10}100$, meaning $1<\\log_{10}17<2$.  Thus, the desired sum is $1+2=\\boxed{3}$."
