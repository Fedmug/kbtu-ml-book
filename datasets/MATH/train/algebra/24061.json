    "problem": "For what value of $k$ does the line represented by the equation $1-kx = -3y$ contain the point $(4,-3)$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $(4, -3)$ lies on the line, we plug $x = 4$ and $y = -3$ into the equation to get $1 - 4k = -3\\cdot -3 \\Rightarrow k = \\boxed{-2}$."
