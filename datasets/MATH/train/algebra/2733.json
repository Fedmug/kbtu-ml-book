    "solution": "Since $v$ appears in the first row, first column, and on diagonal, the sum of the remaining two numbers in each of these lines must be the same. Thus, $$25+18 = 24 +w = 21+x,$$ so $w = 19$ and $x=22$. now 25,22, and 19 form a diagonal with a sum of 66, so we can find $v=23$, $y=26$, and $z=20$. Hence $y+z=\\boxed{46}$."
