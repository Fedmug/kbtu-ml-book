    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We square both sides to get rid of the square root sign.  This gives us $5+2z = 121$.  Solving for $z$ gives $z = \\boxed{58}$.  We squared an equation, so we have to test our solution to make sure it isn't extraneous.  We have\n\\[\\sqrt{5 +2 \\cdot 58} =\\sqrt{121} = 11\\]so our solution is valid."
