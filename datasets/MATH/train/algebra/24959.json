    "problem": "Solve for the largest value of $x$ such that $5(9x^2+9x+10) = x(9x-40).$ Express your answer as a simplified common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Expanding, we have $45x^2 +45x + 50 = 9x^2 - 40x.$ Hence, we see that $36x^2 + 85x + 50 = (4x+5)(9x+10) = 0.$ Therefore, $x = -\\dfrac{5}{4}$ or $x = -\\dfrac{10}{9}.$ Of these, the greater value for $x$ is $x = \\boxed{-\\dfrac{10}{9}}.$"
