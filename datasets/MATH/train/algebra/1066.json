    "problem": "Let $C$ be the circle with equation $x^2-6y-3=-y^2-4x$. If $(a,b)$ is the center of $C$ and $r$ is its radius, what is the value of $a+b+r$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can rewrite the equation $x^2-6y-3=-y^2-4x$ as $x^2+4x+y^2-6y=3$. Completing the square, we have $(x+2)^2-4+(y-3)^2-9=3$, or $(x+2)^2+(y-3)^2=16$. This is the equation of a circle of radius $r=4$ and with center $(a,b)=(-2,3)$. Therefore, $a+b+r=-2+3+4=\\boxed{5}$."
