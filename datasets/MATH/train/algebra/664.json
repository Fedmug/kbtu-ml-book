Since the opposite ends of a diameter are symmetric with respect to the center of the circle, we must travel the same distance and direction from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ as we do from $(2,3)$ to the other endpoint.  To go from $(-1,-1)$ to $(2,3)$ we run $3$ (left dashed red line) and rise $4$ (left dashed blue line), so our other endpoint has coordinates $(2+3,3+4)=\\boxed{(5,7)}$."
