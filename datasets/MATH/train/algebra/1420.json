    "problem": "The square root of $x$ is greater than 2 and less than 4. How many integer values of $x$ satisfy this condition?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have: $4 > \\sqrt{x} > 2$. Squaring, we get $16 > x > 4$.  Thus, the integers from 15 to 5, inclusive, satisfy this inequality. That's a total of $15-5+1=\\boxed{11}$ integers."
