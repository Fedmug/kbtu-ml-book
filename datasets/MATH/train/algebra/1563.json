    "problem": "The value $2^8 -1$ is divisible by 3 prime numbers. What is the sum of the three prime numbers?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Factor twice using difference squares to obtain $(2^8-1)=(2^4+1)(2^4-1)=(2^4+1)(2^2+1)(2^2-1)=17\\cdot5\\cdot3$. The sum of the 3 prime factors of $2^8-1$ is $17+5+3=\\boxed{25}$."
