    "problem": "A gasoline tank is $\\frac78$ full. After $12$ gallons have been used, it is half full. How many gallons does this tank hold when it is full?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $x$ represent the number of gallons the tank holds when it is full. We know that the difference between $\\frac78$ full and $\\frac12$ full is 12 gallons, so we set up an equation and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\n12&=\\frac78x-\\frac12x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12&=\\frac38x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n12\\cdot\\frac83&=x\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n32&=x\n\\end{align*} The tank holds $\\boxed{32}$ gallons when it is full."
