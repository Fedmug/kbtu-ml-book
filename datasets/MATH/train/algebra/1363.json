    "problem": "The amount of algae covering the Smith's backyard pond doubled every day until it was completely covered in algae on day $30$ of the month. On what day of that month was $75\\%$ of the pond algae-free?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We are trying to find the day of the month on which the pond was $75\\%$ algae-free, or the day when the pond was $25\\%$ covered. On day $30$ of the month the pond was completely covered, and the amount of algae doubled every day. This means that on day $29$, the pond was half covered in algae, and therefore on day $\\boxed{28}$ the pond was $25\\%$ covered in algae."
