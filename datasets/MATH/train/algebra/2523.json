    "problem": "Suppose that $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$.  If $\\alpha = -3$ when $\\beta = -6$, find $\\alpha$ when $\\beta = 8$.  Express your answer as a fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$, by definition $\\alpha\\beta = k$ for some constant $k$.  Plugging in, we see that $(-3)\\cdot (-6) = k$, so $k = 18$.  So when $\\beta = 8$, we have that $8\\alpha = 18$, or $\\alpha = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{4}}$."
