    "problem": "What is the $y$-intercept of the line $x - 2y = 5$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The $y$-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the $y$-axis.  The $x$-coordinate of such a point is 0.  Setting $x=0$ in the equation gives $-2y = 5$, so $y = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{2}}$."
