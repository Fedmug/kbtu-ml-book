    "problem": "What is the positive difference between the sum of the first 20 positive even integers and the sum of the first 15 positive odd integers?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is $2 + 4 + \\dots + 40 = 2(1 + 2 + \\dots + 20)$.  For all $n$, $1 + 2 + \\dots + n = n(n + 1)/2$, so $2(1 + 2 + \\dots + 20) = 20 \\cdot 21 = 420$.\n\nThe sum of the first 15 positive odd integers is $1 + 3 + \\dots + 29$.  The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so this sum is equal to $(1 + 29)/2 \\cdot 15 = 225$.  The positive difference between these sums is $420 - 225 = \\boxed{195}$."
