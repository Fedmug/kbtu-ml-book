    "problem": "If $x-y=15$ and $xy=4$, what is the value of $x^2+y^2$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Squaring both sides of the first equation, we get that $x^2-2xy+y^2=225$. So, we know that $x^2+y^2=225+2xy$. Since $xy=4$, we find $x^2+y^2=225+2(4)=\\boxed{233}$."
