    "problem": "What is the value of the following expression: $\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{1}{27}-\\frac{1}{81}+\\frac{1}{243}$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "This is a geometric series with 5 terms, a first term of $1/3$, and a common ratio of $-1/3$. The sum of this series is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}-\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot(-\\frac{1}{3})^5}{1-(-\\frac{1}{3})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}+(\\frac{1}{3})^6}{1+\\frac{1}{3}}=\\boxed{\\frac{61}{243}}$."
