    "problem": "What is the domain of $y=\\dfrac{x^3-27}{x+27}$?  (Express your answer using interval notation.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The only values of $x$ that would make this fraction undefined are values that makes the denominator $0$. Therefore, the fraction is undefined when $x+27=0$, or when $x=-27$. Hence, the solution is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,-27)\\cup(-27,\\infty)}$."
