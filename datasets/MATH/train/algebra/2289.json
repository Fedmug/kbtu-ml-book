    "problem": "The average of Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages is 9. Four years ago,  Chris was the same age as Amy is now. In 3 years, Ben's age will be $\\frac{2}{3}$ of Amy's age at that time. How many years old is Chris now?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let Amy's, Ben's, and Chris's ages be $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively. We have the equations \\begin{align*} \\tag{1}\n\\frac{a+b+c}{3}=9 \\Rightarrow a+b+c&=27 \\\\ \\tag{2}\nc-4&=a\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb+3&=\\frac{2}{3}(a+3)\n\\end{align*} From Equation (3), we have $b=\\frac{2}{3}(a+3)-3$. We substitute Equation (2) into Equation (3) to eliminate $a$, to get $b=\\frac{2}{3}(c-1)-3$. Substituting this last equation and Equation (2) into Equation (1) to eliminate $a$ and $b$, we have  \\[[c-4]+[\\frac{2}{3}(c-1)-3]+c=27\\] Solving for $c$, we find that $c=13$. Thus, Chris's age is $\\boxed{13}$."
