    "problem": "The sum of 49 consecutive integers is $7^5$. What is their median?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The sum of a set of integers is the product of the mean of the integers and the number of integers, and the median of a set of consecutive integers is the same as the mean. So the median must be $7^5/49=7^3$, or $\\boxed{343}$."
