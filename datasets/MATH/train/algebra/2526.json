    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Solving $2y + x + 3 = 0$ for $y$ gives $ y = \\frac{-1}{2}x - \\frac{3}{2},$ so the slope of this line is $-\\frac{1}{2}.$\n\nSolving $3y + ax + 2 = 0$ for $y$ gives $ y = \\frac{-a}{3}x - \\frac{2}{3},$ so the slope of this line is $- \\frac{a}{3}.$\n\nIn order for these lines to be perpendicular, we must have $$\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{a}{3}\\right) = -1.$$Solving for $a$ gives $a = \\boxed{-6}.$"
