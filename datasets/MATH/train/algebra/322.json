    "problem": "Fully factor the following expression: $2x^2-8$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can factor out a $2$ from both terms, giving $(2)(x^2-4)$. Then we can factor the second expression because it is a difference of squares, giving $\\boxed{(2) (x+2) (x-2)}$."
