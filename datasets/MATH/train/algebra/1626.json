    "problem": "What is the constant term in the expansion of $(x^4+x+5)(x^5+x^3+15)$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We only need to look at the constant terms; all the other terms will have variables in them when multiplied.  Thus we have $(5)(15)$, which equals $\\boxed{75}$."
