    "problem": "Factor the following expression: $55z^{17}+121z^{34}$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The greatest common factor of the two coefficients is $11$, and the greatest power of $z$ that divides both terms is $z^{17}$. So, we factor $11z^{17}$ out of both terms:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n55z^{17}+121z^{34} &= 11z^{17}\\cdot 5 +11z^{17}\\cdot 11z^{17}\\\\\n&= \\boxed{11z^{17}(5+11z^{17})}\n\\end{align*}"
