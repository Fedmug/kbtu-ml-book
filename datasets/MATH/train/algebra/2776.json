    "problem": "In a rectangular coordinate system, what is the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point (7, -24)?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula: $$\\sqrt{(7-0)^2 + ((-24)-0)^2} = \\sqrt{49+ 576} = \\sqrt{625} = \\boxed{25}.$$- OR -\n\nNote that the origin, the point $(7, -24)$, and the point $(7, 0)$ form a right triangle with legs of length 7 and 24. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the length of the hypotenuse is $\\boxed{25}$."
