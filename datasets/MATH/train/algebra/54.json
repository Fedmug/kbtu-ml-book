    "problem": "The bacteria in a lab dish double in number every four hours. If 500 bacteria cells are in the dish now, in how many hours will there be exactly 32,000 bacteria?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "32000 bacteria is $32000/500=64$ times the number currently in the lab dish. Since $64=2^6$, the bacteria had to double 6 times to reach this number. Since the bacteria double every four hours, it takes $4\\cdot6=\\boxed{24}$ hours."
