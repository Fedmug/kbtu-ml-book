    "problem": "Line $m$ has the equation $y = 3x + 5$.  Line $n$ has the equation  $y = kx - 7$.  Lines $m$ and $n$ intersect at the point $(-4, -7)$.  What is the value of $k$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since both lines intersect at the point $(-4,-7)$, line $n$ must pass through this point.  We can substitute these coordinates into the equation $y=kx-7$ and solve for $k$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n-7&=k(-4)-7\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -7&=-4k-7\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 0&=-4k\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\boxed{0}&=k\n\\end{align*}"
