    "problem": "If $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive with $xy=24$, $xz = 48$, and $yz=72$, what is the value of $x+y+z$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $$x=\\frac{24}{y}=\\frac{48}{z}$$ we have $z = 2y$. So $72\n= 2y^2$, which implies that $y=6$, $x = 4$, and $z = 12$. Hence $x+y+z = \\boxed{22}$."
