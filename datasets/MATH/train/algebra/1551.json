    "problem": "Suppose a function $f(x)$ is defined on the domain $[-8,4]$. If we define a new function $g(x)$ by $$g(x) = f(-2x),$$ then what is the domain of $g(x)$? Express your answer in interval notation.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $g(x) = f(-2x)$, which is defined if and only if $-2x$ is in the domain of $f$, that is, if $$-8 \\le -2x \\le 4.$$ Dividing all expressions in this chain of inequalities by $-2$ compels us to reverse the direction of the inequalities: $$4\\ge x\\ge -2.$$ Thus $g(x)$ is defined if and only if $-2\\le x\\le 4$. In other words, the domain of $g(x)$ is $\\boxed{[-2,4]}$."
