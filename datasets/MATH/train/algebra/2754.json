    "problem": "Monica is trying to solve the following equation by completing the square: $$x^2-8x+8 = 0.$$She successfully rewrites the above equation in the following form: $$(x + b)^2 = c,$$where $b$ and $c$ are integers. What is the value of $b + c$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We rewrite the equation as follows, trying to create a square of a binomial on the left side: \\begin{align*}\nx^2 - 8x + 8 &= 0\\\\\nx^2 - 8x + 16 &= 8\\\\\n(x - 4)^2 &= 8.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $b = -4$ and $c = 8$, and $b + c = \\boxed{4}.$"
