    "problem": "What is the positive difference between $\\frac{6^2 + 6^2}{6}$ and $\\frac{6^2 \\times 6^2}{6}$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $\\frac{6^2 + 6^2}{6} = \\frac{6^2}{6} + \\frac{6^2}{6} = 6 + 6 = 12$ and $\\frac{6^2 \\times 6^2}{6} = \\frac{6^2}{6}\\times 6^2 = 6\\times 6^2 = 6\\times 36 = 216$, so the positive difference between the two is $216 - 12 = \\boxed{204}$."
