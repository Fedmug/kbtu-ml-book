    "problem": "Three positive integers have a sum of 72 and are in the ratio 1:3:4. What is the least of these three integers?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the smallest integer be $x$.  Then the others are $3x$ and $4x$, and the sum of the three is $8x$.  So $x=\\frac{72}{8}=\\boxed{9}$."
