    "problem": "What is the sum of the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment with endpoints $(8, 5)$ and $(2, -1)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We find that the midpoint is $\\left(\\frac{8+2}{2},\\frac{5-1}{2}\\right) = (5, 2)$. Thus, our answer is $5 + 2 = \\boxed{7}$."
