    "problem": "Suppose that $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$.  If $\\alpha = 4$ when $\\beta = 9$, find $\\alpha$ when $\\beta = -72$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $\\alpha$ is inversely proportional to $\\beta$, by definition $\\alpha\\beta = k$ for some constant $k$.  Plugging in, we see that $4\\cdot 9 = k$, so $k = 36$.  So when $\\beta = -72$, we have that $-72\\alpha = 36$, or $\\alpha = \\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$."
