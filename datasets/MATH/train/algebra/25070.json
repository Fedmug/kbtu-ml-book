    "problem": "To calculate $41^2$, David mentally figures the value $40^2$ and adds 81. David subtracts a number from $40^2$ to calculate $39^2$. What number does he subtract?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $39^2 = (40 - 1)^2 = 40^2 - 2\\cdot 40 \\cdot 1 +1 = 40^2 - 79$. Therefore, David subtracts $\\boxed{79}$."
