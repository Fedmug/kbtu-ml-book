    "problem": "The side length of square $A$ is 36 cm. The side length of square $B$ is 42 cm. What is the ratio of the area of square $A$ to the area of square $B$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The ratio of their areas is going to be the ratio of their side lengths, but squared. The ratio of the side length of square A to that of B is $\\frac{36}{42}=\\frac{6}{7}$. Thus, the ratio of their areas is $\\left( \\frac{6}{7} \\right) ^2=\\boxed{\\frac{36}{49}}$."
