    "solution": "Let $a=2013$. The expression is equal to $\\frac{a^3-2a^2(a+1)+3a(a+1)^2-(a+1)^3+1}{a(a+1)}$. We notice a common factor of $a(a+1)$ in the second and third terms of the numerator, so we split the fraction apart: $$\\frac{-2a^2(a+1)+3a(a+1)^2}{a(a+1)}+\\frac{a^3-(a+1)^3+1}{a(a+1)}$$The first part of the expression is equal to $-2a+3(a+1)$, which simplifies to $a+3$.\n\nThe second part of the expression has a numerator that can be factored as a difference of cubes. We will concentrate on the numerator for now: \\begin{align*}\na^3-(a+1)^3+1 &= (a-(a+1))(a^2+a(a+1)+(a+1)^2)+1 \\\\\n&= (-1)(a^2+a^2+a+a^2+2a+1)+1 \\\\\n&= (-1)(3a^2+3a+1)+1 \\\\\n&= -3(a^2+a)-1+1 \\\\\n&= -3a(a+1)\n\\end{align*}Alternatively, we can expand the numerator, and factor:\n\\begin{align*}\na^3 - (a + 1)^3 + 1 &= a^3 - (a + 1)(a + 1)(a + 1) + 1 \\\\\n&= a^3 - (a^2 + 2a + 1)(a + 1) + 1 \\\\\n&= a^3 - (a^3 + 3a^2 + 3a + 1) + 1 \\\\\n&= a^3 - a^3 - 3a^2 - 3a - 1 + 1 \\\\\n&= -3a^2 - 3a \\\\\n&= -3(a^2 + a) \\\\\n&= -3a(a + 1).\n\\end{align*}Taken with the denominator, the second half of the expression simply equals $\\frac{-3a(a+1)}{a(a+1)}=-3$.\n\nPutting it back with the first half of the expression, the final expression equals $(a+3)+(-3)=a=\\boxed{2013}$."
