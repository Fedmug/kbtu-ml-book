    "problem": "Solve for $n$: $5^{2n + 1} = \\frac{1}{25}$. Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$\\frac{1}{25}$ is equal to $5^{-2}$, so we have $5^{2n+1}=5^{-2}$.  This gives us $2n+1=-2$.  Solving for $n$ gives us $n=\\boxed{-\\frac{3}{2}}$."
