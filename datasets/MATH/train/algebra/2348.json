    "problem": "Solve for $n$: $0.03n + 0.08(20 + n) = 12.6$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Expanding the product on the left gives $0.03n + 0.08\\cdot 20 + 0.08n = 12.6$.  Simplifying the left side gives $0.11n + 1.6 = 12.6$.  Subtracting 1.6 from both sides gives $0.11n = 11$, and dividing by 0.11 gives $n = \\boxed{100}$."
