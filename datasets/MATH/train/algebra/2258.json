    "problem": "A line is described by the equation $y-4=4(x-8)$. What is the sum of its $x$-intercept and $y$-intercept?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "To solve for the $x$-intercept, we let $y$ equal 0, and then solve for the value of $x$ as shown: \\begin{align*}\n0-4&=4(x-8)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad -1&=(x-8)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 7&=x\n\\end{align*} Similarly, let $x$ equal 0, and solve for the $y$-intercept: \\begin{align*}\ny-4&=4(0-8)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y-4&=-32\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y&=-28\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the sum of the $x$ and $y$ intercepts is $7+(-28)=\\boxed{-21}$."
