    "problem": "Solve for $x$: $\\frac{3x - 1}{4x-4} = \\frac23$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Multiplying both sides by $4x-4$ and by 3 gives $3(3x-1) = 2(4x-4)$.  Expanding the products on both sides gives $9x-3 = 8x - 8$.  Subtracting $8x$ from both sides $x -3 = -8$ and adding 3 to both sides gives $x = \\boxed{-5}$."
