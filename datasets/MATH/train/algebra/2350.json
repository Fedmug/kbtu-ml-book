    "problem": "In Mr. Abraham's class, $10$ of the $15$ students received an $A$ on the latest exam. If the same ratio of students received an $A$ on Mrs. Berkeley's latest exam, and if Mrs. Berkeley has $24$ students total, how many students in Mrs. Berkeley's class received an $A$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If $10$ of $15$ students received an $A$, then the ratio of students receiving an $A$ to students not receiving an $A$ is $\\frac{10}{15}$, or $\\frac{2}{3}$. Let $x$ be the number of students in Mrs. Berkeley's class who received an $A$. Since the ratio is consistent across the two classes, $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{x}{24}$. Cross-multiplying yields $x = \\frac{24\\cdot 2}{3}$, so, by simplification, we can see that $\\boxed{16}$ of Mrs. Berkeley's students must have received an $A$."
