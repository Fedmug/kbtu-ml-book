    "solution": "The number of toothpicks in each stage form an arithmetic sequence.  The first term in this arithmetic sequence is 4, and the common difference is 3 (the number of toothpicks added to get to the next stage), so the number of toothpicks used in the 250th stage is $4 + 3 \\cdot 249 = \\boxed{751}$."
