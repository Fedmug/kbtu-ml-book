    "problem": "Moving along a particular line in the Cartesian plane, when the $x$-value increases by 3 units, the $y$-value increases by 7 units. When the $x$-value increases by 9 units, by how many units will the $y$-value increase?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If increasing the $x$ value by 3 units increases the $y$ value by 7, then increasing the $x$ value by $3\\cdot3=9$ units will increase the $y$ value by $7\\cdot3=\\boxed{21}$ units."
