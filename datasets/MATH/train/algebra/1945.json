    "problem": "At Academic Academy, to pass an algebra test you must score at least $80\\%$. If there are 35 problems on the test, what is the greatest number you can miss and still pass?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If you must score at least $80 \\%$, then you cannot miss more than $20 \\% = 1/5$ of the problems. $1/5$ of $35$ is equal to $7$, so you can miss at most $\\boxed{7}$ problems and still pass."
