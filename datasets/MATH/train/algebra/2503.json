    "solution": "We first find the equations of the lines $l$ and $m.$ Since $l$ passes through $(0,5)$ and $(3,0),$ its slope is $$\\frac{0 - 5}{3 - 0} = -\\frac{5}{3}.$$Since it passes through $(0,5),$ its $y$-intercept is $(0,5)$ so $l$'s equation is $y = -\\frac{5}{3}x + 5.$\n\nSince $m$ passes through $(0,2)$ and $(7,0)$, it has slope $$\\frac{0 - 2}{7 - 0} = -\\frac{2}{7}.$$Since $m\\text{'s}$ $y$-intercept is $(0,2),$ its equation is $y = -\\frac{2}{7}x + 2.$\n\nNow we find the $x\\text{'s}$ at which $m$ and $l$ reach $y = 15.$ Setting $y = 15$ in both equations, we solve: $$y = 15 = -\\frac{5}{3}x + 5.$$Subtracting $5$ and multiplying by $-\\frac{3}{5}$ for both sides, we get $x = -6.$ Thus, $l$ reaches $y = 15$ when $x = -6.$ Now we solve $$y = 15 = -\\frac{2}{7}x + 2.$$Subtracting $2$ and multiplying by $-\\frac{7}{2}$ for both sides, we get $x = -45.5.$ Thus, $m$ reaches $y = 15$ when $x = -45.5.$\n\nThus, $(-6) - (-45.5) = \\boxed{39.5},$ which is our answer."
