    "problem": "If $a \\div b = 2$ and $b \\div c = \\frac{3}{4}$, what is the value of $c \\div a$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $\\dfrac{b}{a} \\cdot \\dfrac{c}{b} = \\dfrac{c}{a}$, we simply multiply the reciprocals of $a \\div b$ and $b \\div c$ together: $(1/2)(4/3) = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$."
