    "problem": "Find $a+b+c$ if the graph of the equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is a parabola with vertex $(5,3)$, vertical axis of symmetry, and contains the point $(2,0)$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the axis of symmetry is vertical and the vertex is $(5,3)$, the parabola may also be written as  \\[y=a(x-5)^2+3\\]for some value of $a$.  Plugging the point $(2,0)$ into this equation gives  \\[0=a(2-5)^2+3=9a+3.\\]This tells us $a=-\\frac13$.\n\nOur equation is  \\[y=-\\frac13(x-5)^2+3.\\]Putting it $y=ax^2+bx+c$ form requires expanding the square, so we get  \\[y=-\\frac13(x^2-10x+25)+3={-\\frac13 x^2+\\frac{10}{3}x-\\frac{16}3}.\\]Therefore, $a+b+c = \\boxed{-\\frac73}$."
