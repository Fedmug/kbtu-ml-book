    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The square of the binomial $rx+s$ is  \\[(rx+s)^2=r^2x^2+2rsx+s^2.\\]If this is equal to $ax^2+15x+4$, then $s$ must be either 2 or -2.  Since $(rx+s)^2=(-rx-s)^2$, we may choose either $s=2$ or $s=-2$, and the solution will be the same.  We choose $s=2$.\n\nThe square of $rx+2$ is  \\[(rx+2)^2=r^2x^2+4rx+4.\\]If this is equal to $ax^2+15x+4$ then we must have $15=4r$ or $r=\\frac{15}4$.  This gives our square: \\[\\left(\\frac{15}4x+2\\right)^2=\\frac{225}{16}x^2+15x+4.\\]Therefore $a=\\boxed{\\frac{225}{16}}$."
