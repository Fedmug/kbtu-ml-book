    "problem": "A line with slope 3 intersects a line with slope 5 at the point $(10,15)$. What is the distance between the $x$-intercepts of these two lines?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The two lines have equations \\[\ny -15=3(x-10)\\quad\\text{and}\\quad y -15=5(x-10).\n\\]The $x$-intercepts, obtained by setting $y=0$ in the respective equations, are 5 and 7.  The distance between the  points $(5,0)$ and $(7,0)$ is $\\boxed{2}$."
