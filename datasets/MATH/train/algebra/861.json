    "problem": "Find the distance between the points $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$. Express your answer in simplest radical form.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The horizontal separation between $(1,1)$ and $(4,7)$ is $4-1=3$ units.  The vertical separation between the points is $7-1=6$ units.  Therefore, the segment whose endpoints are (1,1) and (4,7) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs measure 3 units and 6 units.  By the Pythagorean, the length of this segment is $\\sqrt{3^2+6^2}=3\\sqrt{1^2+2^2}=\\boxed{3\\sqrt{5}}$."
