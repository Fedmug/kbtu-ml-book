    "problem": "What is the sum of all values of $z$ such that $z^2=12z-7$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can rewrite $z^2=12z-7$ as $z^2-12z+7=0$. Because the sum of the roots of a quadratic is $\\dfrac{-b}{a}$, we know that the sum of all values of $z$ such that $z^2-12z+7=0$ is $\\dfrac{-(-12)}{1}=\\boxed{12}$."
