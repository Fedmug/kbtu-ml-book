    "problem": "The first term of a geometric sequence is 729, and the 7th term is 64. What is the positive, real value for the 5th term?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The only positive, real common ratio for this sequence is $\\frac{2}{3}$.  Thus, if $x$ is the 5th term, then $\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 x = 64$, so $x = \\boxed{144}.$"
