    "problem": "If $x+y=\\frac{7}{12}$ and $x-y=\\frac{1}{12}$, what is the value of $x^2-y^2$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$x^2 - y^2$ factors into $(x+y)(x-y)$, so, to obtain the value of $x^2 - y^2$, simply multiply $\\frac{7}{12}\\cdot \\frac{1}{12}$ to get $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{144}}$."
