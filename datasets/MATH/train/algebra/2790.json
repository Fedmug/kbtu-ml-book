    "problem": "A box of 25 chocolate candies costs $\\$6$. How many dollars does it cost to buy 600 chocolate candies?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "600 chocolate candies is $\\frac{600}{25} = 24$ times as many candies as 25 candies.  Multiplying the number of candies by 24 multiplies the cost by 24, so 600 candies costs $24\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{144}$ dollars."
