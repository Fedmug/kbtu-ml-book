    "problem": "What number results when 50 is increased by $120\\%$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Because $120\\%$ of 50 is $1.2(50) = 60$, when we increase 50 by $120\\%$, we get $50 + 60 = \\boxed{110}$.  Alternatively, we could find our answer by multiplying 50 by $1 + 1.2 = 2.2$, which also gives us $\\boxed{110}$."
