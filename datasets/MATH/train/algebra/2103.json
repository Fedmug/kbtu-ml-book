    "problem": "Eighty-five more than the square of a number is the same as the square of the quantity that is $17$ less than the number. What is the number?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the number is $x$, we set up the equation $x^2+85=(x-17)^2$ and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\nx^2+85&=(x-17)^2\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx^2+85&=x^2-34x+289\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n34x&=204\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\nx&=6\n\\end{align*} The number is $\\boxed{6}$."
