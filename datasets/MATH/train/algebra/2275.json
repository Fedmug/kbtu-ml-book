    "solution": "The graphs labelled (3), (4), and (5) are all invertible since no horizontal line intersects the graph in more than one place. In other words, for each real number $y$ there is at most one real number $x$ with $f(x)=y$. The first graph does not satisfy this condition. Thus the product of the labels corresponding to invertible functions is $3\\times 4\\times 5=\\boxed{60}$."
