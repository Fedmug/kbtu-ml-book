    "problem": "A student accidentally added five to both the numerator and denominator of a fraction, changing the fraction's value to $\\frac12$. If the original numerator was a 2, what was the original denominator?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $d$ be the original denominator.  After adding 5 to both numerator and denominator, the fraction becomes $\\frac{7}{d+5}$.  If a fraction with 7 in the numerator is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{2}$, then the denominator is 14.  Solving $d+5=14$, we find $d=\\boxed{9}$."
