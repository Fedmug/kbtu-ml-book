    "problem": "What is the minimum value of $y$ if $y=3x^2+6x+9?$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First, complete square as follows: $$y=3x^2+6x+9=3\\left(x^2+2x\\right)+9.$$ To complete the square, we need to add $\\left(\\frac{2}{2}\\right)^2=1$ after the $2x.$ So we have $$y+3=3\\left(x^2+2x+1\\right)+9.$$ This gives $$y=3\\left(x+1\\right)^2+6.$$ Now, since $\\left(x+1\\right)^2\\ge0,$ the minimum value is when the squared term is equal to $0.$ So the minimum value is $$y=3\\left(x+1\\right)^2+6=3\\cdot0+6=\\boxed{6}.$$"
