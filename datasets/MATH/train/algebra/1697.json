    "solution": "Since 2 is not a multiple of 3 or 7, $f(2)=2+3=5$ and we want to find an $a$ where $f^a(2)=5$. So, we keep track of how many times we evaluate $f$ of our previous result until we get 5.  \\begin{align*}\nf(2)&=5\\\\\nf(f(2))&=f(5)=5+3=8 \\qquad 5 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\\\\nf(f(f(2)))&=f(8)=8+3=11 \\qquad 8 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\\\\nf^4(2)&=11+3=14 \\qquad 11 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\\\\\nf^5(2)&=3\\cdot14=42 \\qquad 14 \\text{ is a multiple of 7.}\\\\\nf^6(2)&=\\frac{42}{21}=2 \\qquad 42 \\text{ is a multiple of 3 and 7.}\\\\\nf^7(2)&=2+3=5 \\qquad 2 \\text{ is not a multiple of 3 or 7.}\n\\end{align*}So the least $a>1$ for which $f^a(2)=f(2)$ is $a=\\boxed{7}$."
