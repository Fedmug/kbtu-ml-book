    "problem": "An infinite geometric series has common ratio $-1/5$ and sum $16.$  What is the first term of the series?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the first term be $a$.  Because the sum of the series is $16$, we have $16= \\frac{a}{1-(-1/5)} = \\frac{a}{6/5} = \\frac{5a}{6}$.  Therefore, $a=\\boxed{\\frac{96}{5}}$."
