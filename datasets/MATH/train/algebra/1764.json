    "problem": "The area of the floor in a square room is 225 square feet. The homeowners plan to cover the floor with rows of 6-inch by 6-inch tiles. How many tiles will be in each row?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The length of each side of the room is $\\sqrt{225}=15$ feet, or $15\\cdot12=180$ inches. Since each tile has a length of 6 inches, each row needs $180/6=\\boxed{30}$ tiles."
