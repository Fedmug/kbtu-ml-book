    "problem": "How many cubic feet are in three cubic yards?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Cubing both sides of  \\[\n1\\text{ yard}=3\\text{ feet}\n\\] we find that 1 cubic yard equals 27 cubic feet.  Therefore, 3 cubic yards are equal to $27\\cdot3=\\boxed{81}$ cubic feet."
