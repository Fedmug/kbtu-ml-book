    "problem": "After traveling 50 miles by taxi, Ann is charged a fare of $\\$120$. Assuming the taxi fare is directly proportional to distance traveled, how much would Ann be charged (in dollars) if she had traveled 70 miles?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $d$ equal the cost of a 70 mile taxi ride. Since we know that Ann was charged $120 dollars a 50 mile taxi ride, we can set up the proportion $\\frac{120}{50}=\\frac{d}{70}$. If we solve for $d$ by multiplying both sides by 70, we find that $d=\\left(\\frac{120}{50}\\right)(70)=\\boxed{168}$ dollars."
