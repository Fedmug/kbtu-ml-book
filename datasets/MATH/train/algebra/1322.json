    "problem": "On a Cartesian coordinate plane, points $(2,1)$ and $(3, 4)$ are adjacent points on a square. What is the area of the square?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We use the distance formula to find the distance between the two points, which is the side length of the square.\n$\\sqrt{(3-2)^2+(4-1)^2}=\\sqrt{1+9} = \\sqrt{10}$. Therefore, the area of the square is $(\\sqrt{10})^2 = \\boxed{10}$."
