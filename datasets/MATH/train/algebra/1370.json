    "problem": "It takes four painters working at the same rate $1.25$ work-days to finish a job. If only three painters are available, how many work-days will it take them to finish the job, working at the same rate? Express your answer as a mixed number.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The number of workers will be inversely proportional to the time needed to complete the job.  This means that the product $(\\text{number of workers})\\times(\\text{days to complete job})$ will be a constant.  In this case, that constant will be: $$4\\times 1.25=5$$ For three workers, the product will remain the same.  Let $D$ equal the number of days needed for three workers to complete the job.  Then, \\begin{align*}\n3\\times D&=5\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad D&=5/3=\\boxed{1\\frac{2}{3}} \\text{work-days}.\n\\end{align*}"
