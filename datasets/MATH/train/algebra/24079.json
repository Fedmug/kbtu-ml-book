    "problem": "A line through the points $(2, -9)$ and $(j, 17)$ is parallel to the line $2x + 3y = 21$. What is the value of $j$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The slope of the given line is $-\\frac23$, and the line through the points must have the same slope. This means that \\[\n\\frac{17-(-9)}{j-2}=-\\frac23\n\\] We can multiply out denominators to get $3(26)=-2(j-2)$, or $-39=j-2$ and $j=\\boxed{-37}$."
