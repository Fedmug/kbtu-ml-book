    "problem": "What is the product of the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints at $(2,3)$ and $(-6,5)$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since the midpoint of a segment has coordinates that are the average of the endpoints, we see that the midpoint has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{2 - 6}{2}, \\frac{3+5}{2}\\right) = (-2, 4)$.  Thus our desired answer is $-2\\cdot 4 = \\boxed{-8}$."
