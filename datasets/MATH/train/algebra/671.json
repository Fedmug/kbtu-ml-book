    "problem": "What is the next term in the geometric sequence $$2, 6x, 18x^2, 54x^3, \\ldots ?$$ Express your answer in terms of $x$.",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common ratio is $\\frac{6x}{2} = 3x$; that is, each term is obtained by multiplying $3x$ to the previous term. The next term is thus $54x^3 \\cdot 3x = \\boxed{162x^4}$."
