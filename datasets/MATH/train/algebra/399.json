    "problem": "Given that $x$ is real and $x^3+\\frac{1}{x^3}=52$, find $x+\\frac{1}{x}$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $$\\left(x+\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^3=x^3+3(x^2)\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)+3(x)\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)^3=x^3+\\frac{1}{x^3}+3\\left(x+\\frac{1}{x}\\right).$$Let $x+\\frac{1}{x}=a$. Then our equation is $a^3=x^3+\\frac{1}{x^3}+3a$. We know $x^3+\\frac{1}{x^3}=52$, so we have $a^3=52+3a$ or $a^3-3a-52=0$. By the rational root theorem, the possible roots of this polynomial equation are the divisors of 52 as well as their negatives: $\\pm1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 13, \\pm 26, \\pm 52$.  Both $\\pm1$ and $\\pm2$ are easy to check by substitution. For $\\pm 4$ we can use synthetic division (or substitution), and we find that that $a=4$ is a root. (We could also see this by inspection by writing $a^3-3a=52$ and noting that $4$ works.)\n\nAre there other solutions? Use synthetic division to divide:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}\n$4$&$1$&$0$&$-3$&$-52$\\\\\n$$&$\\downarrow$&$4$&$16$&$52$\\\\ \\hline\n$$&$1$&$4$&13$$&$0$\n\\end{tabular}\nThe quotient is $a^2+4a+13$, so $a^3-3a-52 = (a-4)(a^2+4a+13)$. The discriminant of $a^2+4a+13$ is $4^2-4(1)(13)=16-52=-36$, which is negative, so there are no other real solutions for $a$. If $x$ is real, $a$ must be real, so we conclude that there are no other values of $x+\\frac{1}{x}$. Thus $x+\\frac{1}{x}=a=\\boxed{4}$."
