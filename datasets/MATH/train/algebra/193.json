    "problem": "Let $p$ and $q$ satisfy $pq=9$ and $p+q=6$. What is the value of $p^2 + q^2$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have two equations and two variables, so it's possible to solve for $p$ and $q$ directly and then calculate $p^2$ and $q^2$ separately to get our answer. However, doing so involves a fair amount of computation with complex numbers and square roots, so we look for an alternative approach. We square the second equation to get $$(p+q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 36,$$which is close to what we want but has the extra $2pq$ term. Since we know that $pq=9$, we can substitute to get $$p^2 + 2(9) +q^2 = 36 \\implies p^2+q^2 = \\boxed{18}.$$Note that our task was made easier by only solving for what the problem asked rather than by trying to solve for $p$ and $q$ individually."
