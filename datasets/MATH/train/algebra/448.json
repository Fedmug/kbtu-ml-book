    "problem": "Find all solutions to the equation $\\displaystyle\\sqrt[3]{2 - \\frac{x}{2}} = -3$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We get rid of the cube root sign by cubing both sides.  This gives us $2-\\frac{x}{2} = -27$.  Solving this equation gives $x =\\boxed{58}$."
