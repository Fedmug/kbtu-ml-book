    "problem": "Antonette gets $70\\%$ on a 10-problem test, $80\\%$ on a 20-problem test and $90\\%$ on a 30-problem test. If the three tests are combined into one 60-problem test, which percent is her overall score, rounded to the nearest percent?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Note that $70\\%$ of 10 is 7, $80\\%$ of 20 is 16 and $90\\%$ of 30 is 27. Antonette answers $7+16+27=50$ problems correctly out of 60 problems in all. Her overall score is $\\frac{50}{60}$ or $83.\\overline{3}\\%$. Rounded to the nearest percent, the answer is $\\boxed{83\\%}$."
