    "problem": "What is the domain of the function $$\\ell(y) = \\frac{1}{(y-2)+(y-8)}~?$$ Express your answer in interval notation.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can simplify: $$\\ell(y) = \\frac{1}{2y-10}.$$ The fraction $\\frac{1}{2y-10}$ fails to be defined only if the denominator is zero. This occurs when $y$ is the solution of the equation $$2y-10=0,$$ which is $y=5$. Thus the domain of $\\ell(y)$ is $\\boxed{(-\\infty,5)\\cup (5,\\infty)}$."
