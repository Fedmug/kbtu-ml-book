    "problem": "What is the degree of the polynomial $(3x^2 +11)^{12}$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The degree of the polynomial is the degree of the highest term.  Since the degree of $3x^2 +11$ is 2 and since $(x^a)^{12} = x^{12a}$ for any positive constant $a$, the answer is $2 \\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$."
