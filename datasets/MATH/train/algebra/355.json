    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We note that $(2x)^2 + 2\\cdot 37 \\cdot 2x + 37^2 = (2x + 37)^2$. In order for this expression to be a multiple of 47, $2x + 37$ must be a multiple of 47. Since we want the least positive value of $x$, we will want $2x + 37 = 47$. It follows that $x = \\boxed{5}$."
