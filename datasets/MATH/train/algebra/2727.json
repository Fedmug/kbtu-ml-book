    "problem": "The arithmetic mean of an odd number of consecutive odd integers is $y$. Find the sum of the smallest and largest of the integers in terms of $y$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the first odd integer be $a$.  Let the rest of the odd integers be $a+2, a+4, a+6, \\dots , a+ 2(n-1)$, for a total of $n$ integers.  The arithmetic mean of these integers is equal to their sum divided by the number of integers, so we have  \\[ y = \\frac{na + (2+4+6+\\dots + 2(n-1))}{n}\\] Notice that $2+4+6+\\dots + 2(n-1) = 2(1+2+3+\\dots + n-1) = 2\\frac{(n-1)(n-1+1)}{2} = n(n-1)$.  Substituting and multiplying both sides by $n$ yields \\[ yn = na + n(n-1)\\] Dividing both sides by $n$, we have  \\[ y = a+ n-1\\] The sum of the smallest and largest integers is $a + a+ 2(n-1)$, or $2a+2(n-1)=2(a+n-1)=2y$.\n\nHence the answer is $\\boxed{2y}$."
