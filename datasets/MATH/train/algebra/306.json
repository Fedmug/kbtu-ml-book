    "problem": "Complex numbers are often used when dealing with alternating current (AC) circuits. In the equation $V = IZ$, $V$ is voltage, $I$ is current, and $Z$ is a value known as impedance. If $V = 1-i$ and $Z=1+3i$, find $I$.  Express your answer as a complex number in the form $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We have $$\nI = \\frac{V}{Z} = \\frac{1-i}{1+3i}.\n$$ Multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, we get \\begin{align*}\nI &= \\frac{1-i}{1+3i} \\cdot \\frac{1-3i}{1-3i}\\\\\n& = \\frac{1(1) + 1(-3i) - i(1) - i(-3i)}{1(1) + 1(-3i) + 3i(1) + 3i(-3i)}\\\\\n& = \\frac{-2-4i}{10}\\\\\n& = \\boxed{ -\\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{2}{5}i }.\n\\end{align*}"
