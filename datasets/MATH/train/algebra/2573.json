    "problem": "How many nonnegative solutions are there to the equation $x^2 = -4x$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can rearrange the equation as $x^2 + 4x = 0$.  Factoring gives $x(x+4)=0$, which has solutions $x=0$ and $x=-4$.  Only $\\boxed{1}$ of these solutions is nonnegative."
