    "problem": "Find the solution to $x|x| = 2x+1$ which has the smallest value.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We consider two cases, $x$ is nonnegative (so $|x| = x$), and $x$ is negative (so $|x| = -x$).\n\nWhen $x\\ge 0,$ the equation becomes $x^2-2x-1=0$.  Applying the quadratic formula gives $ x=1\\pm\\sqrt{2}.$  However, $x$ must be nonnegative in this case, so we have $x = 1+\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWhen $x<0,$ the equation becomes $x^2+2x+1=0$, so $(x+1)^2 = 0$ and $x=-1$.\n\nThus, the smallest value of $x$ is $x=\\boxed{-1}.$"
