    "problem": "When Frederick was born, his grandparents gave him a gift of $\\$2000$, which was invested at an interest rate of $5\\%$ per year, compounded yearly.  How much money will Frederick have when he collects the money at the age of $18$? Give your answer to the nearest hundredth of a dollar.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Five percent growth corresponds to multiplication by $1+5\\%=1.05$.  So, the amount of money Frederick will have in $18$ years is $2000(1+.05)^{18}=\\boxed{\\$4813.24}$."
