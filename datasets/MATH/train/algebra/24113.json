    "problem": "The second and fourth terms of a geometric sequence are 2 and 6. Which of the following is a possible  first term? Type the letter of the correct option.\n\nA. $-\\sqrt{3}$\n\nB. $-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$\n\nC. $-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$\n\nD. $\\sqrt{3}$\n\nE. $3$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let the sequence be denoted  \\[a, ar, ar^2, ar^3,\\dots\\]with $ar = 2$ and $ar^3 = 6$. Then $r^2 = 3$ and $r = \\sqrt{3}$ or $r = -\\sqrt{3}$. Therefore  $a = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ or $a =\n-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}$, which is choice $\\boxed{B}$."
