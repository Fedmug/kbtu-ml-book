    "problem": "Find the greatest value of $a$ such that $a^2-10a+21 \\le 0$.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We factor the quadratic, getting $(a-7)(a-3) \\le 0$. The expression is equal to $0$ when $a=7 \\text{ or } 3$. When $a \\le 3$ or $a \\ge 7$, the quadratic is positive, since the two factors have the same sign. When $3 \\le a \\le 7$, the quadratic is non-positive. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{7}$ is the greatest value of $a$ for which $a^2 - 10a + 21\\le 0$."
