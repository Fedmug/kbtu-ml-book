    "solution": "The terms of sequence $A$ are $2,$ $4,$ $8,$ $16,$ $32,$ $64,$ $128,$ $256,$ $512.$ The terms of sequence $B$ start from $20$ and go up by $20$ each time, so sequence $B$ is precisely all multiples of $20$ from $20$ to $320.$ We thus need to see which term in sequence $A$ is closest to a multiple of $20.$ $16,$ $64,$ and $256$ are the closest, each being $4$ away from a multiple of $20.$ So the least positive difference between a term in sequence $A$ and one in sequence $B$ is $\\boxed{4}.$"
