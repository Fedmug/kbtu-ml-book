    "problem": "Point $A$ is at $(0, 0)$ and point $B$ is on the line $y = 4$. The slope of segment $AB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$. What is the sum of the $x$- and $y$-coordinates of point $B$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Point B has coordinates $(x,4)$.  We know the slope of $AB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$, so we know that: $\\frac{4-0}{x-0} = \\frac{2}{3}$, thus, $x = 6$, and the sum of the coordinates of point B is $\\boxed{10}$."
