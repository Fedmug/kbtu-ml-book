    "problem": "The two lines $y = 4x - 19$ and $2x+y = 95$ intersect. What is the value of $x$ at the point of intersection?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "At the intersection of two lines, the $x$'s are equal and the $y$'s are equal. We may set $4x - 19 = 95 - 2x$ to find an $x$, where the $y$'s are equal.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n4x - 19 &= 95 - 2x \\\\\n6x &= 114 \\\\\nx &= \\boxed{19}.\n\\end{align*}"
