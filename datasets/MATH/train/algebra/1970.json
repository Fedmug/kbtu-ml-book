    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Either the $y$ coordinate is twice the $x$ coordinate, in which case we have the line $y=2x$, or the $x$ coordinate is twice the $y$ coordinate, in which case we have the line $y=\\frac{1}{2}x$. The graph of these two lines is shown below:\n\n[asy]\nLabel f;\n\nf.p=fontsize(3);\n\nxaxis(-5,5,Ticks(f, 1.0));\n\nyaxis(-10,10,Ticks(f, 1.0));\n\ndraw((-5,-10)--(5,10),Arrows);\ndraw((-5,-2.5)--(5,2.5),Arrows);\n[/asy]\n\nThe plane is split into $\\boxed{4}$ regions."
