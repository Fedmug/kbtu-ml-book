    "problem": "Let the operation $\\#$ be defined as $\\#(a, b, c) = b^2 - 4ac$, for all real numbers $a, b$ and $c$. What is the value of $\\#(1, 2, 3)$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Substitute $1$ for $a$, $2$ for $b$, and $3$ for $c$ in the expression $b^2-4ac$ to find that $\\#(1,2,3)=2^2-(4)(3)(1)=\\boxed{-8}$."
