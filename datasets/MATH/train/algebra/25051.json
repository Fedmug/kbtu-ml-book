    "problem": "Rural School USA has 105 students enrolled. There are 60 boys and 45 girls. If $\\frac{1}{10}$ of the boys and $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the girls are absent on one day, what percent of the total student population is absent?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$\\frac{1}{10}$ of $60$ boys is $60/10=6$ students, while $\\frac{1}{3}$ of $45$ girls is $45/3=15$ students, so $21$ students were absent that day. Since we know that $\\frac{21}{105}=\\frac{1}{5}$ and $\\frac{1}{5}$ is equal to $20\\%$, we know that $\\boxed{20 \\%}$ of the total student population was absent."
