    "problem": "The first three terms of an arithmetic sequence are 1, 10 and 19, respectively. What is the value of the 21st term?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common difference for this arithmetic sequence is $10 - 1 = 9$, so the $21^{\\text{st}}$ term is $1 + 9 \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{181}$."
