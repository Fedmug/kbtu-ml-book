    "problem": "If $a,b,c$ satisfy the system of equations  \\begin{align*}b + c &= 12-3a \\\\\na+c &= -14 - 3b \\\\\na+b &= 7 - 3c,\n\\end{align*} what is $2a + 2b + 2c$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Summing all three of the given equations yields $2a + 2b + 2c = (12 - 14 + 7) - 3a - 3b - 3c$, so $5a + 5b + 5c = 5$. It follows that $2a + 2b + 2c = \\boxed{2}$."
