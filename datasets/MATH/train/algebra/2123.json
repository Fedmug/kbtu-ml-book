    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let's start by rewriting this problem into equation form:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 50, \\\\\nx - y &= 6.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find $xy$, so let's find $x$ and $y$ separately.\n\nBegin by adding the two equations:  \\begin{align*}\n2x &= 56 \\\\\nx &= 28\n\\end{align*} Now, subtract the two equations \\begin{align*}\n2y &= 44 \\\\\ny &= 22\n\\end{align*}\n\nSo then $x \\cdot y = 22 \\cdot 28 = \\boxed{616}$"
