    "problem": "Max bought a new dirt bike and paid $10\\%$ of the cost upfront, which was $\\$150$. What was the price of the bike?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If $10\\%$ of the price of the dirt bike was $\\$150$, then $100\\%$ of the price must have been ten times the amount that Max paid upfront. Therefore, the price of the bike must have been $10 \\times \\$150=\\boxed{\\$ 1500}$."
