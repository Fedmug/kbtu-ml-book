    "problem": "If 25$\\%$ of a number is the same as 20$\\%$ of 30, what is the number?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the number is $x$, we set up the equation $\\frac{25}{100}x=\\frac{20}{100}(30)$, which means $\\frac14x=\\frac15(30)=6$. So $x=6\\cdot4=24$. The number is $\\boxed{24}$."
