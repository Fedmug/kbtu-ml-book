    "problem": "What is the positive difference between the $2000^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term and the $2005^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the arithmetic sequence $-8,$ $-2,$ $4,$ $10,$ $\\ldots$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The common difference in this arithmetic sequence is $-2 - (-8) = 6$.  The $2000^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + 1999d$, and the $2005^{\\text{th}}$ term is $a + 2004d$, so the positive difference between these two term is $(a + 2004d) - (a + 1999d) = 5d = 5 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{30}$."
