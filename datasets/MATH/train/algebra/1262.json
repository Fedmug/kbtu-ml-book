    "problem": "Find all solutions to the equation $\\displaystyle\\sqrt[3]{3 - x} = -\\frac{3}{2}$.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We get rid of the cube root sign by cubing both sides.  This gives us $3-x = -\\frac{27}{8}$.  Solving this equation gives $x = 3 + \\frac{27}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{51}{8}}$."
