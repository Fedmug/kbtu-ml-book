    "problem": "Compute the sum of all the roots of $(2x+3)(x-4)+(2x+3)(x-6)=0$.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The quadratic factors as $(2x + 3)(x - 4 + x - 6) = (2x + 3)(2x - 10) = 2(2x + 3)(x - 5).$  Thus, the roots are $-\\frac{3}{2}$ and 5, and their sum is $\\boxed{\\frac{7}{2}}.$"
