    "problem": "If $x$ is a real number and $x^2 = 16$, what is the sum of all possible values of $x$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The only two real numbers that satisfy the equation $x^2 = 16$ are $4$ and $-4$. So, the sum of all possible values of $x$ is $\\boxed{0}$."
