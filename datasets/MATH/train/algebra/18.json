    "problem": "Karl was attempting to calculate economic figures. He found the following equation to be true:\\[fp-w=10000\\]If $f=5$ and $w=5+125i$, what is $p$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Substitute in the given numbers. We have $5p-5-125i=10000$, so $5p=10005+125i$, thus $p=\\boxed{2001+25i}$."
