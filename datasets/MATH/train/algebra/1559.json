    "problem": "If $27^8=9^q$, what is $q$?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the base 2: $(3^3)^8=(3^2)^q$, which simplifies to $3^{24}=3^{2q}$. Setting the exponents equal to each other, $24=2q$, or $q=\\boxed{12}$."
