    "problem": "Suppose that $2x^2 - 5x + k = 0$ is a quadratic equation with one solution for $x$. Express $k$ as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the quadratic equation has exactly one solution, then the discriminant, $5^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot k = 25 - 8k$, must be equal to zero. Thus, $25 - 8k = 0 \\Longrightarrow k = \\boxed{\\frac{25}{8}}$."
