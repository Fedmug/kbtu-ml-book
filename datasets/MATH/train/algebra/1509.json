    "problem": "Find the value of $x$ that satisfies $\\frac{\\sqrt{5x}}{\\sqrt{3(x-1)}}=2$. Express your answer in simplest fractional form.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We begin by multiplying out the denominator and then  squaring both sides \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{5x}}{\\sqrt{3(x-1)}}&=2\\\\\n(\\sqrt{5x})^2 &=\\left(2\\sqrt{3(x-1)}\\right)^2\\\\\n5x &= 12(x-1)\\\\\n12& =7x\\\\\nx&=\\boxed{\\frac{12}{7}}.\\\\\n\\end{align*}Checking, we see that this value of $x$ satisfies the original equation, so it is not an extraneous solution."
