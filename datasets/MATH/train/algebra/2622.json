    "problem": "The expression $16x^2-106x-105$ can be written as $(8x + a)(2x + b),$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. What is $a + 2b$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We see that $16x^2-106x-105 = (8x + 7)(2x - 15)$, thus $a = 7$ and $b = -15$ and $a + 2b = \\boxed{-23}.$"
