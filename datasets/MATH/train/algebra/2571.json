    "problem": "If $x+y=\\frac{7}{13}$ and $x-y=\\frac{1}{91}$, what is the value of $x^2-y^2$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We know that $x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)$. Substituting, we see that $x^2 - y^2 = \\frac{7}{13}\\cdot\\frac{1}{91} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{169}}$."
