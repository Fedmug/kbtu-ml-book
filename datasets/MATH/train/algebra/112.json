    "problem": "I have the following terms of an arithmetic sequence: $\\frac{1}{2}, x-1, 3x, \\ldots$. Solve for $x$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Any two consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence must have a common difference. So, $(x-1) - \\frac{1}{2} = (3x) - (x-1)$, or $x - \\frac{3}{2} = 2x+1$. Solving gives $x = \\boxed{-\\frac{5}{2}}$."
