    "problem": "Let $a$ and $b$ be the solutions of the equation $2x^2+6x-14=0$. What is the value of $(2a-3)(4b-6)$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Expanding the desired expression, we get $(2a-3)(4b-6)=8ab-12a-12b+18=8ab-12(a+b)+18$. This implies that we need the sum and product of the roots of the given equation, which are $-6/2=-3$ and $-14/2=-7$, respectively. Thus, the desired expression equals $(8\\cdot -7) - (12 \\cdot -3) + 18 = \\boxed{-2}$."
