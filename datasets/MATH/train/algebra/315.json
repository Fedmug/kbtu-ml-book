    "problem": "Find the $y$-intercept point of the line $3x+5y=20$.  Provide your answer as an ordered pair.",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can find the slope and the $y$-coordinate of the $y$-intercept quickly by putting the equation in slope-intercept form.  Solving the equation $3x+5y=20$ for $y$ in terms of $x$ gives $y = -\\frac{3}{5}x +4$.  So, the $y$-intercept is $\\boxed{(0,4)}$."
