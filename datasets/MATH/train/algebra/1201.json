    "problem": "If the ratio of $b$ to $a$ is 3, then what is the value of $a$ when $b=12-5a$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The given ratio tells us that $\\frac{b}{a}=3$ or that $b=3a$. We substitute this value for $b$ so we have an equation with only one variable. We find  \\begin{align*}\n3a&=12-5a \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad 8a&=12 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad a &= 12/8 \\\\\n\\Rightarrow \\quad a &= \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}.\n\\end{align*}"
