    "solution": "First, we note that if $n$ is a positive integer, then $f(n)$ is also a positive integer.  We claim that $f ( f (\\dotsb f (n) \\dotsb )) = 1$ for some number of applications of $f$ only for $n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,$ and $64.$  (In other words, $n$ must be a power of 2.)\n\nNote that $f(1) = 2,$ so $f(f(1)) = f(2) = 1.$  If $n > 1$ is a power of 2, it is easy to see that repeated applications of $f$ on $n$ eventually reach 1.\n\nSuppose $n$ is an odd positive integer, where $n > 1.$  Write $n = 2k + 1,$ where $k$ is a positive integer.  Since $n$ is odd,\n\\[f(n) = n^2 + 1 = (2k + 1)^2 + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k + 1).\\]Since $2k^2 + 2k$ is always even, $2k^2 + 2k + 1$ is always odd (and greater than 1), so $f(n)$ can never be a power of 2 when $n$ is odd and greater than 1.\n\nNow, suppose $n$ is even.  For example, if $n = 2^3 \\cdot 11,$ then\n\\[f(2^3 \\cdot 11) = f(2^2 \\cdot 11) = f(2 \\cdot 11) = f(11),\\]which we know is not a power of 2.\n\nMore generally, suppose $n = 2^e \\cdot m,$ where $e$ is nonnegative and $m$ is odd.  Then\n\\[f(2^e \\cdot m) = f(2^{e - 1} \\cdot m) = f(2^{e - 2} \\cdot m) = \\dots = f(m).\\]If $m = 1,$ then $n$ is a power of 2, and the sequence eventually reaches 1.  Otherwise, $f(m)$ is not a power of 2.  We also know that $f(m)$ is odd and greater than 1, $f(f(m))$ is not a power of 2 either, and so on.  Thus, the sequence can never reach 1.\n\nTherefore, $n$ must be one of the $\\boxed{7}$ values 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64."
