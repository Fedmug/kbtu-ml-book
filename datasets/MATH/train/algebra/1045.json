    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "To get the square root out of the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{2}+1)$ so that the $\\sqrt{2}$ is squared and $\\sqrt{2}$ and $-\\sqrt{2}$ cancel each other out.  $$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}-1}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{\\sqrt{2}+1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2-\\sqrt{2}+\\sqrt{2}-1}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{1}=\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}+1}$$"
