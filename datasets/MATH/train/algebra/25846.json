    "problem": "How many positive whole numbers have cube roots that are less than $10$? For example, $20$ would count since $\\sqrt[3]{20}<10.$",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The cube root of 1000 is 10; the cube root of any number smaller than 1000 is less than 10.  So, the whole numbers from 1 to 999 are the only positive whole numbers with cube roots less than 10.  There are $\\boxed{999}$ such numbers."
