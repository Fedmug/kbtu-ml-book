    "problem": "Terrell usually lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times. If he uses two 15-pound weights instead, how many times must Terrell lift them in order to lift the same total weight?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If Terrell lifts two 20-pound weights 12 times, he lifts a total of $2\\cdot 12\\cdot20=480$ pounds of weight.  If he lifts two 15-pound weights instead for $n$ times, he will lift a total of $2\\cdot15\\cdot n=30n$ pounds of weight.  Equating this to 480 pounds, we can solve for $n$: \\begin{align*}\n30n&=480\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad n&=480/30=\\boxed{16}\n\\end{align*}"
