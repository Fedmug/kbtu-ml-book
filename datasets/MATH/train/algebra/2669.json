    "problem": "Seven identical bowling balls weigh the same as three identical canoes. If two of the canoes weigh a total of 56 pounds, how many pounds does one of the bowling balls weigh?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $b$ be the weight of one bowling ball and $c$ be the weight of one canoe. We have that $7b=3c$. Multiplying both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}$, we have $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 7b=\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 3c \\Rightarrow \\frac{14}{3}b=2c=56$. Solving this last equation for $b$, we have that one bowling ball weighs $\\boxed{12}$ pounds."
