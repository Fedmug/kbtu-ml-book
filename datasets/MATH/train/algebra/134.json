    "solution": "We start from the inside and work our way out: $$f(-1)=(-1)^2-2(-1)=3.$$ Therefore $$f(f(f(f(f(f(-1))))))=f(f(f(f(f(3)))).$$ Now $f(3)=3^2-2\\cdot3=3$. We can use that fact repeatedly to conclude  \\begin{align*}\nf(f(f(f(f(f(-1))))))&=f(f(f(f(f(3))))\\\\\n&=f(f(f(f(3)))\\\\\n& \\vdots\\\\ &= f(3)=\\boxed{3}.\\end{align*}"
