    "problem": "Let $f(x) = 3x-8$ and $g(f(x)) = 2x^2 + 5x - 3.$ Find $g(-5).$",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We don't know $g(x),$ so we don't have an expression we can simply stick $-5$ in to get an answer. We do, however, know that $g(f(x)) = 2x^2 +5x-3.$ So, if we can figure out what to put into $f(x)$ such that $-5$ is output, we can use our expression for $g(f(x))$ to find $g(-5).$   If $f(x) = -5,$ we have $3x-8 = -5,$ so $x = 1.$ Therefore, letting $x=1$ in $g(f(x)) = 2x^2 +5x - 3$ gives \\[g(-5) = g(f(1)) =2\\cdot 1^2 +5\\cdot 1 - 3 = \\boxed{4}.\\]"
