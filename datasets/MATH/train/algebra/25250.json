    "problem": "Milton spilled some ink on his homework paper. He can't read the coefficient of $x$, but he knows that the equation has two distinct negative, integer solutions. What is the sum of all of the distinct possible integers that could be under the ink stain?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle);\nfill((0,0)--(3,0)--(3,3)--(0,3)--cycle,black);\nlabel(\"$x+36=0$\",(3,1.5),E);\nlabel(\"$x^{2}+$\",(0,1.5),W);\n[/asy]",

    "solution": "Because the quadratic has two distinct integer roots, we know that it can be factored as  \\[(x+r)(x+s),\\] where $r$ and $s$ are positive integers.  Expanding this product gives  $x^2 + (r+s)x + rs$, and comparing this to the given quadratic tells us that $rs = 36$.  So, we consider all the pairs of distinct integers that multiply to 36, and we compute their sum in each case: \\[\\begin{array}{cc|c}\nr&s&r+s\\\\\\hline\n1&36&37\\\\\n2&18&20\\\\\n3&12&15\\\\\n4&9&13\\end{array}\\] Summing the entries in the final column gives us a total of $\\boxed{85}$."
