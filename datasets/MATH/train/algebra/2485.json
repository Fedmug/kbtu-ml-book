    "problem": "What is the slope of a line parallel to $2x+4y=-17$? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can rewrite the given equation as $y = -\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{17}4$.  Since all lines parallel to a given one have the same slope as the given line, our answer is $\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$."
