    "problem": "The graph of the equation $x + 2y + 3 = 0$ is perpendicular to the graph of the equation $ax + 2y + 3 = 0$. What is the value of $a$?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since they are perpendicular, their slopes must multiply to -1. The first line has slope $-\\frac12$ and the second $-\\frac{a}{2}$, so $\\frac{a}{4}=-1$ and $a=\\boxed{-4}$."
