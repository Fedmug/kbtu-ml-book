    "problem": "The first and thirteenth terms of an arithmetic sequence are 5 and 29, respectively. What is the fiftieth term?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $d$ be the common difference in this arithmetic sequence.  Then the $13^{\\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 12d = 29$.  Solving for $d$, we find $d = 2$.  Then the $50^{\\text{th}}$ term is $5 + 49 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{103}$."
