    "The support vector classifier is an extension of the maximal margin classifier and is less sensitive to individual data. Since it allows certain data to be misclassified, it’s also known as the “Soft Margin Classifier”. It creates a budget under which the misclassification allowance is granted. This classifier covers the drawbacks of the maximal margin classifier by allowing for some misclassification and being less reliant on the support vector."

Also, the dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features is 2, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is 3, then the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceeds 3."
