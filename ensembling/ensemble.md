# Ensembling

Ensembling is a machine learning technique that involves combining the predictions of multiple individual models (often referred to as "base models" or "weak learners") to produce a single, more robust and accurate prediction. The idea behind ensembling is to leverage the diversity of different models to collectively make better predictions than any individual model.

Ensembling is widely used in machine learning for both classification and regression tasks. Common ensemble methods include:

1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):
   Bagging involves training multiple base models independently on bootstrapped subsets of the training data and then combining their predictions through averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification). Random Forests are a popular example of a bagging ensemble.

2. Boosting:
   Boosting algorithms iteratively train base models to focus on data points that were misclassified by previous models. Examples include AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

3. Stacking (Stacked Generalization):
   Stacking combines the predictions of multiple base models by training a "meta-model" (often called a "meta-learner") on their predictions. Stacking can capture higher-level patterns and relationships in the data.

4. Voting: Voting ensembles combine the predictions of multiple base models by allowing them to "vote" on the final prediction. There are three types of voting ensembles: hard voting (majority vote), soft voting (weighted average of probabilities), and stacking-based voting.

Ensembling is a powerful technique that can significantly enhance the performance of machine learning models. When building an ensemble, it's important to choose diverse base models, optimize hyperparameters, and consider the trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability. Different ensemble methods may be more suitable for different types of data and problems.
