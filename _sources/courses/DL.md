## Project

Create a group project that solves a real-world problem based on deep learning algorithms. Recommended team size is 2-3 students.

### Final project proposal (deadline 8th week):

- Title: the problem which is going to be solved
- Settling team members roles (data preparation, coding, team leading, etc)
- Link to the dataset (open source is better)
- Architecture or algorithms that you are going to use
- Evaluation methods
- Reference

### Report

- Motivation and Objective (Problem, Challenge)
- Related Work and Originality
- Design Architecture
- Detailed Algorithm or Functions
- Coding
- Results and Performance Evaluation
- Conclusion
- Reference
- Roles of Members
- **Bonus:** make your work visible (GitHub, YouTube, etc)

### Final project presentation (examination week)

- 15 min for presentation + 5 min QA
- Demo in Jupyter Notebook
- All group members should participate during the presentation

The topic can be changed not later than 12th week with providing a new proposal.
