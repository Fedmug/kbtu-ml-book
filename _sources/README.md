# ML Book

```{epigraph}
We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge.

-- Rutherford D. Roger
```

The amount of information is enormous nowadays and it is continuously growing. See [resources](./resources.md) to observe only a tiny fraction of machine learning content available on the Web. Isn't it enough? Why should we create one more piece of content?

There were a lot of Holy Wars about education and all around it. Leaving them aside, I personally formulate the main purpose of education as follows:

```{admonition} The Fundamental Goal of Education
Create conditions allowing students to acquire knowldedge and skills at the desired level in the shortest possible period of time.
```

Our attempt will technically rely on [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), an open-source tool for building publication-quality books and documents from computational material.

Machine learning is the fusion of mathematical principles and programming techniques, enabling systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming instructions
