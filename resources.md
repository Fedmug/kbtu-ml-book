1. {cite:ps}`hastie2009elements` (can be downloaded [here](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf)) is a highly regarded textbook offering comprehensive coverage of statistical learning and machine learning. It provides practical examples and R code for implementation, making it accessible to a broad audience, from beginners to experienced practitioners, and serves as a go-to resource in the fields of statistics and machine learning.

2. [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) is more friendly for beginners as less theoretical and more practical version of the previous textbook. There are two versions: [With Applications in R](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_corrected_June_2023.pdf) and [With Applications in Python](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLP/ISLP_website.pdf). Additional resources such as labs, slides, pictures, videolectures are also provided.

3. {cite:ps}`Bishop2006` ([download link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf)) generally adopts the Bayesian approach to machine learning. It is written in a rigorous mathematical style. Each chapter is supplied by dozens of problems, some of them require quite tough mathematics.

4. {cite:ps}`pml1Book` (more info [here](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html)) is even heavier relied on probabilistic and Bayesian grounds. It pays special attention to deep learning and its applications, the hottest area of machine learning nowadays. Even more modern advanced topics are covered in the second book [Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html).
