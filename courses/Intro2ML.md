# Introduction to ML

The key word is **introduction**. Completing this course one should be acquire knowledge and skills which serve as prerequisits for studying specific branches of machine learning and their applications in depth.

```{admonition} Machine learning = Math + Programming

> Machine learning is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field that has emerged from the symbiotic combination of mathematics and programming. At its core, machine learning leverages mathematical principles, particularly statistics, linear algebra, and calculus, to develop algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. The fusion of these mathematical foundations with programming languages such as Python and R has led to the creation of powerful frameworks and libraries, facilitating the implementation and deployment of complex machine learning models.

Hence, the course constists of the following parts:

* mathematics for ML
* Python libraries and frameworks for ML
* basic model of ML

## Course assessment

| Activity             | Final scores |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Attendance           | $10\%$       |
| Practice             | $30\%$       |
| Midterm              | $20\%$       |
| Final exam           | $40\%$       |

Practice consists of (nearly) weekly assignments in Jupyter Notebooks, around $3$ points each.

## Homeworks

### {ref}`HW1`
* **Soft deadline**: 01.02.2024 11:59 (GMT+6)
* **Hard deadline**: 07.02.2024 11:59 (GMT+6)

### {ref}`HW2`

* **Soft deadline**: 07.02.2024 11:59 (GMT+6)
* **Hard deadline**: 14.02.2024 11:59 (GMT+6)

## Submission notes

Name your file in the format `HWi_GROUPj_NAME_SURNAME.ipynb` where $i$ is homework index, $j$ is group index. There are $4$ groups:

* `GROUP1`: Sergei Wed 13:00 - 15:00 (**TA**: Zarina Abildasheva)
* `GROUP2`: Zhalgas Wed 13:00 - 15:00 (**TA**: Zhandos Makhambetali)
* `GROUP3`: Zhalgas Wed 15:00 - 17:00 (**TA**: Salamat Kuantaiuly)
* `GROUP4`: Zhalgas Sat (**TA**: Ахан Исмаилов)

Then send it to **MS TEAMS** (assignments section).

**Soft deadline:** Wed 11:59 (GMT+6) next week.

**Hard deadline:** Wed 11:59 (GMT+6) next to next week.

Submits after the hard deadline are not accepted. If you submit after the soft deadline, you receive 10% penalty per each day of delay. 

**Example:** If deadline is 01.02.2024 11:59, and submission time is 04.02.2024 11:34, then you mark is multiplied by 0.7 (3 days of delay = 30% penalty). But if you submit one hour later (at 12:34), the penalty will be 40%.

## General recommendations

* Do not erase any existing cells

* Write solutions of the math problems in markdown cells of HW notebook using LaTeX. If you are not familiar with LaTeX, see a 2-page [cheat sheet](http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf) for a quick start

* Provide your solution with understandable comments; do not submit tons of formulas and/or code  cells without any text description of what you are doing

* **Readability counts!** In case of poor writings you may receive penalty up to one point
