[{"question": "You have IQ scores for 1000 people. You model the distribution of IQ scores with the following procedure: Roll the three six-sided dice. Multiply the roll by a constant w. Repeat the process 50 times and take the average of all the results. You try different values for w until the result of your procedure closely matches the average of the real IQ scores. Is your model a generative model or a discriminative model?", "type": "many_choice", "answers": [{"answer": "Generative model", "correct": true, "feedback": "Correct. With each roll, you are essentially generating the IQ of a fictional individual. Additionally, your generative model accurately reflects the normal distribution of IQ scores, which follow a bell curve pattern."}, {"answer": "Discriminative model", "correct": false, "feedback": "Incorrect. A discriminative model would aim to discriminate between various types of IQ scores. For instance, a discriminative model could attempt to classify an IQ score as real or fake."}, {"answer": "Not enough information to answer", "correct": false, "feedback": "Try again. This model does fit the definition of one of two types of models."}]}]
