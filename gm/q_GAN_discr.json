[{"question": "In GANs, what happens when the discriminator is no longer capable of distinguishing between real and generated samples?", "type": "many_choice", "answers": [{"answer": "Discriminator becomes the generator", "correct": false}, {"answer": "Discriminator becomes more efficient", "correct": false}, {"answer": "Generator updates its weights", "correct": true, "feedback": "Correct. When the discriminator cannot differentiate, it means that the generator has made substantial progress in updating its weights, which enables the generator to capture the important features and patterns of the training data and generate high-quality samples. "}, {"answer": "Training stops", "correct": false}]}]
