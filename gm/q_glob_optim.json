[{"question": "How accurate will the discriminator be for GAN models at the global optimum?", "type": "many_choice", "answers": [{"answer": "1", "correct": false}, {"answer": "0.5", "correct": true, "feedback": "Correct. As the generator undergoes training and improves its performance, the discriminator's ability to differentiate between real and fake samples weakens, because the discriminator can't easily tell the difference between real and fake. If the generator succeeds perfectly, then the discriminator has a 50% accuracy. Essentially, the discriminator resorts to a random coin toss to make its predictions."}, {"answer": "0.3", "correct": false}, {"answer": "None of those", "correct": false}]}]
