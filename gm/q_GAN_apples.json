[{"question": "Regarding a successful Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that generates images of apples, the following statements are correct:", "type": "many_choice", "answers": [{"answer": "After traing the GAN, the discriminator loss eventually converges to a constant value.", "correct": true, "feedback": "Correct. In a GAN, as the generator becomes more proficient at generating realistic images, it is expected that the discriminator loss will eventually reach a constant value."}, {"answer": "The discriminator can be utilized to classify images as either apple or non-apple.", "correct": false, "feedback": "Incorrect. The primary objective of the discriminator is to differentiate between real and generated/fake images, not specifically classify them as apple vs. non-apple."}, {"answer": "The generator has the capability to generate previously unseen images of apples.", "correct": true, "feedback": "Correct. The generator in a GAN is designed to generate new and unseen images that resemble the distribution of the training data, in this case, images of apples."}, {"answer": "The objective of the generator is to learn and capture the underlying distribution of apple images.", "correct": true, "feedback": "Correct. The primary goal of the generator is to learn and replicate the distribution of apple images, enabling it to generate realistic and accurate images of apples."}]}]
