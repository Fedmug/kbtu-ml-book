    "# Bayesian inference\n",
    " \n",
    " Bayesian inference is a way of reasoning that combines prior knowledge and data to estimate the probability of a hypothesis. In the Bayesian model, prior knowledge is understood as what you already know or believe about a situation based on your experience, expertise, or assumptions. On the other hand, data is new evidence that you collect as a result of observations, experiments, or surveys. The probability of a hypothesis is how likely it is to be true, considering both the prior knowledge and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian inference consists of three steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We choose a probability density function to model the parameter $θ$, that is, the a prior distribution $p(θ)$ . This is our best guess on the parameters before we get the data $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Probability function We choose a probability density function for $p(X|θ)$ . Essentially we are modeling how the data X will look like with the given parameter $θ$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Posterior probability We compute the posterior distribution $p(θ|X)$ and choose the $θ$ with the highest $p(θ|X)$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the posterior distribution becomes the new a prior distribution. The third step needs to be repeated each time new data arrives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical equation of Bayesian Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian inference uses a mathematical formula called Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as new data becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "{p(θ|X)} = \\frac{p(X|\\theta)\\times p(\\theta)} {p(X)}\n",

    "$p(θ|X)$ - the posterior distribution.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "When the paramters of the distribution generated by the data are equal to $θ$, the probability density of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "No we assume that $X$ and $θ$ are continous. We will discuss later how to relax this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *The prior*\n",
    "\n",
    "The second building block our inference is the prior:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol p(θ)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The prior is the subjective probability density associated with the parameter $θ$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *The posterior*\n",
    "\n",
    "After obseving data $X$, we operate Bayes' rule to update the prior about the parameter $θ$ (the formula is given below)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we fit a model with parameters $\\boldsymbol w$ to the dataset $\\boldsymbol D = (\\boldsymbol X, \\boldsymbol y)$. According to the Bayes formula the posterior distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    p(\\boldsymbol w \\vert \\boldsymbol X, \\boldsymbol y) \\propto p(\\boldsymbol y \\vert \\boldsymbol X, \\boldsymbol w) p(\\boldsymbol w).\n",
